1,ONE OF US: From $330 million to $9 million - German Hedge Fund Allianz YOLOs the NYC subway pension fund,Schrodingersdawg,1601383932,"https://nypost.com/2020/09/28/allianz-accused-of-wiping-out-mta-pension-funds-amid-covid-crash/

&gt; Allianz increased risky investment positions in its Structured Alpha family of funds instead of exiting them — a “negligent and imprudent bet” that “proved to be disastrous” as stocks continued to plunge, the complaint says.

&gt; As a result, its Structured Alpha 1000 fund — where MTA pensions had an account balance of more than $330 million at the end of last year — dropped nearly 87 percent for the year by mid-March, according to the suit.

&gt; After Allianz was forced to liquidate that fund in late March, the MTA pension funds were left with just about $9 million — an investment value loss of than 97 percent in a single quarter, the complaint alleges.

&gt; The recent market downturn
Restructuring had historically been relatively limited as a percentage of total Portfolio positions. However, as equity markets declined and volatility increased into March 2020, per the strategy’s design, the portfolio managers implemented multiple rounds of restructuring trades. For example, as markets declined the Portfolio Management team replaced near-to-the-money short S&amp;P 500 puts and short NASDAQ puts with new short puts struck at prices further away from then-current market levels. While re-establishing alpha-generating positions at lower strike prices, this resulted in realized losses on the near-to-the-money short puts.

&gt; Similarly, the portfolio managers replaced short-term short VIX calls with new longer-term short VIX calls at more distant strike prices. An analogous process occurred for short VXX calls. In some instances, this restructuring was repeated on subsequent days on legacy positions and on positions that represented the new restructured legs. Despite these steps, the Portfolio ultimately could not be restructured quickly enough to keep pace with the market decline, resulting in additional losses.

&gt; The below graphic provides an example of the restructuring efforts in the Portfolio for a set of SPX short put options expiring on March 20, 2020 that were held by the Structured Alpha 1000 fund. During the eleven trading days between March 2 and March 16, there were at least four instances of restructuring of these short put positions to lower risk by both reducing the strike prices of the put options and by decreasing the number of positions held. Nevertheless, although the market was up on certain days in this period, the market ultimately continued to decline through these lower strike prices, causing losses to the Structured Alpha 1000 fund.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j1ylrv/one_of_us_from_330_million_to_9_million_german/

6,Walmart Triples TSLA Semi Reservations,ElitePhoenix-,1601382578,"Walmart Canada is more than tripling its reservations of 18-wheeler Tesla Semi trucks as it drives towards its commitment to alternative power.

Walmart Canada is now reserving  a total of 130 Tesla Semi trucks, making it one of the largest reservations of electrified trucks in the country. The move comes on the heels of Walmart Canada announcing a major $3.5 billion investment over the next five years aimed to generate significant growth in the business and is aligned with  Walmarts global goal to target zero emissions by 2040 announced at Climate Week earlier this month

Walmart Canada has built a best-in-class supply chain and is continuing to put sustainability at the forefront of its business operations, finding new and innovative ways to reduce its carbon footprint while continuing to focus on safety and delivering value to its customers. Walmart Canada is committed to converting 20 per cent of Walmart's fleet to electric power by the end of 2022, as part of the goal of its broader goal to power its fleet using 100 per cent alternative power by 2028.

""Tripling our reservation of Tesla Semi trucks is part of our ongoing effort to innovate the business and prioritize sustainability,"" said John Bayliss, Senior Vice-president, Logistics and Supply Chain, Walmart Canada. ""By converting 20 per cent of our fleet to electric vehicles by the end of 2022 and committing to alternative power for all fleet vehicles by 2028, we are putting safety, innovation and sustainability at the forefront of our logistics network.""

The company cites the following sustainability and safety features as key highlights on the new Tesla Semi electric trucks:

Tesla Semi consumes less than two kilowatt-hours of energy per mile at Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) and highway speed, significantly reducing operating costs per mile compared to diesel.
500 miles range allows a driver to go to their destination and back without recharging (500 mile range at maximum weight at highway speed)
Capable of 0-60 mph in 20 seconds with a full 80,000-pound load and can climb 5 per cent grades at a steady 65 mph (compared to 45mph for same grade in a diesel truck)
Regenerative braking technology recovers 98 per cent of kinetic energy to the battery
Surrounding vehicle cameras and sensors aid object detection and minimize blind spots, automatically alerting the driver to safety hazards and obstacles
Additional driver safety features including Automatic Emergency Braking, Automatic Lane Keeping, Lane Departure Warning
The ability to travel 500 miles per charge is in line with Walmart Canada's general fleet system, which consists mainly of single day round trips – allowing for the ability to convert from diesel at a faster pace. The enhanced driver safety features also offer a significant opportunity for the company to continue to address this critical issue.

11,Decade’s Hottest Stocks Reflect Hunger for Anything Tech,tundraaaa,1601381125,"The decade of the tech stock? Now there’s an understatement.  
  
That means a $5,000 investment in the personal computer maker at the start of the ‘90s would be worth more than $4.5 million today. You could have become a Dell millionaire by putting in only about a grand.  
Ouch.  
  
Still, in an era when many tech investors like to trade rapidly in and out of stocks, the ‘90s performances show how lucrative a buy-and-hold strategy can be--when you buy the right stock.  
  
Propelled by superstars--as well as by many new issues that have begun trading in recent years--the technology-oriented Nasdaq composite index has risen 774% this decade, through Monday, while the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 314%.  
  
All told, the ‘90s market blockbusters are on a different scale than ‘80s blockbusters. Most of the ‘80s stars were consumer-oriented and included many retailers. Tech stocks in the ‘80s were largely viewed as a boom or bust investment play; many investors preferred to bet on a continuation of Americans’ conspicuous consumption.  
  
Whether the ‘90s tech stars’ stock gains will be sustained is another question. For now, here’s a closer look at some names that had the potential to make investors super-rich in the decade now ending:  
  
* Dell, the No. 1 stock, found a better way of doing things: selling personal computers directly to consumers either by phone or, more recently, via the Internet.  
  
Chief Executive Michael Dell bet on volume, volume, volume as the company cut PC costs by skipping the middleman and building to order. The increasingly computer-savvy public loved the idea. But as PC unit sales slow, some analysts wonder whether the company can continue to grow at its torrid pace.   
  
* One of the decade’s biggest trends--industry consolidation--has benefited Clear Channel Communications Inc., a network of radio and TV stations whose stock has surged 14,488% in the ‘90s. Though the acquisitive company has grown rapidly, analysts expect more of the same: Per-share earnings are projected to rise nearly 30% annually over the next few years.  

* Microsoft, of course, is synonymous with Windows, the personal computer operating system of the ‘90s. But some analysts now are betting that its free rival, Linux, will be the system of the ‘00s, which is why Red Hat Inc. and VA Linux Systems Inc. are two of the hottest new stock offerings of 1999.  
  
Chief Executive Bill Gates, however, has long kept Microsoft ahead of the curve, and plenty of analysts and investors are betting that it can stay there. At $615 billion, it’s the world’s biggest stock by market value, and the shares have recently taken flight for the umpteenth time, gaining 31% in the last month.
* The ‘90s saw the rise of the individual investor, as average folks started making more of their own investing decisions. Many turned to discount brokerage innovator Charles Schwab Corp.

18,Coding your own stop-loss bot to prevent MM's from hunting your stops?,Power80770M,1601379452,"I read on WSB recently (can't find the exact post) that stop-loss order info gets sold to market makers, and that this info essentially tips your hand to what price you're willing to sell. And the market makers therefore train machine learning algos to hunt for your stops; to manipulate the stock price in the short term to get you to sell to them at the low, and then they turn around and quickly sell to someone else for a profit. 

So it got me thinking: can't this be thwarted by coding your own stop-loss trading bot (assuming you know how to code, and assuming your broker has a trading API)?

Basically only your code would know the stop price, and your code would place a market order when it sees the underlying hitting that price. Voila, you get the same mechanics of a stop-loss, without having to tip your hand to MM's. 

If all traders did this, would it screw over the market makers? Would it be valuable to individual traders? Is there a product idea here that's feasible (""Stop Loss as a Service"")?",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j1xjb9/coding_your_own_stoploss_bot_to_prevent_mms_from/

There were lots of tendies to be had here. I enjoyed many, &amp; was happy to hear I wasn't alone. But one thing's for sure - I get long-winded at times, so I'm trying my best to make my DD posts as succinct &amp; short for your limited attention spans. Still though, fuck you in advance.

\-------------------------------------------  
Let's get the party started: 

  
Remember this?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y7bihk24y1q51.jpg?width=569&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64cbe74c338ce1fbbc226ba436704186fd378473

  
Yeah, usage of this is downward trending - evident in Altria's [$8.6 billion writedown](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312520133822?cik=764180) on its investment in Juul over 2019. Ongoing studies of the health impacts of vapor-type tobacco products continue to point towards health deterioration &amp; the legal pressures are mounting. Altria (Juul's parent co) is currently handling [621 legal cases](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/76418020000074?cik=764180) against them for JUST Juul as of 7/2020.  


Will all of these e-vapor kids eventually switch to traditional tobacco products? Who knows - the CDC estimates around \~21% - \~28% of vape users eventually try a cigarette or cigar; but what really drew people into vapes?  


***In my view - it was the ease, the ability to take a quick puff in indoor settings, &amp; the quick disappearance of evidence. All of that plus a slight head high &amp; cool smoke looking shit.***   


If anyone has ever been to Asia &amp; some parts of Europe - you will have noticed this:  


https://preview.redd.it/zscjcwt4y1q51.jpg?width=481&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71e336c6528a3f24d6dac2ffefccffbc07874c41

  
It is ubiquitous - shit is everywhere here. If you're into vaping, or anything of that nature, this is the best alternative the market has to offer. Even serves as an alternative for regular cigarette users (more later).   


People in the U.S. might not know of iQOS now - but Phillip Morris International (NYSE: PM) just got [FDA approval for marketing iQOS as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (""MRTP"")](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200707005847/en/FDA-Authorizes-Marketing-of-IQOS-as-a-Modified-Risk-Tobacco-Product#:~:text=On%20April%2030%2C%202019%2C%20the,the%20protection%20of%20public%20health) a few months ago, in July 2020. You will for sure start to see these pop up in convenience stores &amp; be on commercials going forward. 

  
This FDA designation is something Juul would have KILLED for, &amp; probably thought an investment in them by Altria would provide them with the lobbying resources to get them this designation or something similar. But they are failing in this regard, badly. 

  
iQOS is the **ONLY** **e-nicotine product to be granted marketing orders through the FDA's MRTP process** &amp; the FDA even goes onto say that *""..switching completely from conventional cigarettes to the iQOS system reduces your body's exposure to harmful chemicals""*. So we have a market of people who want to quit cigarettes plus in my view, fallout users of e-vape products. 

  
Now we have a scenario where the U.S. has just opened its regulatory regime to be an open door for PM to market this shit. All of the work Juul did to introduce young adults &amp; kids to tobacco products is now a ripe market for PM to sell iQOS products to &amp; it provides the same experience / benefits as traditional e-vaping products. In that - it is *easy to use, you can use it indoors as the smell dissipates fairly quickly, you get your nicotine hit, it emits cool smoke - &amp; get this - in Asia there are even flavored products that you know PM is going to sneak into the U.S.* If you don't believe me, go ask your wife's boyfriend to buy you one &amp; try it out. 

  
A bit more about PM before we dive into some numbers. These guys trace their lineage back to 1847, so they've been in business around 173 years. Fucking the boomer's boomer company here. These boomer companies have high dividends, &amp; subpar growth. Really, they grow just enough to beat inflation &amp; pay out their dividend (Currently yielding \~6%/year). On top of this, prior to iQOS, their business is/was antiquated as fuck - cigarette usage is declining &amp; excluding iQOS from 2007 - 2016 their revenues grew at a pathetic 1.4% CAGR. Which brings me to this idea - if a Company like this can turn into a quasi-revenue or even full on growth story, what are the potential upsides?  

  
Let's look at some results for iQOS:

* [From 2019 to 2018 - Heated Tobacco shipments grew +44%](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/141332920000007?cik=1413329) vs. Traditional Cigg volumes being down -4.5% 

[As of most recent quarter, PM has acquired \~1MM iQOS users per quarter for an overall user base of 15.4MM. This user acquisition has grown by +43&amp;#37; since 2018 when they were growing iQOS users by \~0.7mm a quarter \[1\]](https://preview.redd.it/83z2robey1q51.jpg?width=592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e00ba718a00ae7f4d193e3538c2af3746a87daab)

&amp;#x200B;

[Current conversion rate of 72&amp;#37; vs. 67&amp;#37; 2-years ago \[1\]](https://preview.redd.it/lmihqnvfy1q51.jpg?width=476&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f16f93deebec91f038cbd236c2afc5332c332206)

* PM defines 'fully converted' as one that uses iQOS products for 95% of daily tobacco consumption over trailing 7 days
* As a reference point - e-vape conversion rate is in the mid-teens \[1\]
* Wall Street expects this conversion rate to rise &amp; level off at 76% \[1\]
* Of the total user base of 15.4MM @ 72% conversion rate = 11.1MM active users
* More room to go - as of 12/31/19 total vape users globally is \~40MM \[1\]

\-------

So all of this we reach the following conclusions: the market opportunity is huge, it's been relatively under-penetrated, &amp; PM's iQOS has a leading edge. What about TAM? Currently, PM makes about \~$450 on average in net revenues per user. Assuming they capture the size of just the e-vaping market of \~40mm users, this is an &gt;$18Bn opportunity. The fact that we're even talking about TAMs &amp; shit about a 173 year old Company, is in my view, insane. This stock will have boomer buyers &amp; Robinhood autists when this thing really gets moving. 

Look at the Google search trends stateside over the last couple years on ""iQOS"":

Evidence that PM's marketing machine is getting work since the FDA's MRTP approval.

**Valuation:**

So at yesterday's close of $76.31/Share, these guys are trading at \~10.1x EV/Forward EBITDA. This is *below* their historical 1-year average of trading at \~11x and very below their 3-year historical average trading level of \~12x. 

Versus their Tobacco peers, \~10x represents an \~8% premium, but on average they traded at an 8% premium over 1-year periods to their Tobacco peer group. This premium in my view, is not a 'growth' premium - this is premium is primarily related to PM's array of leading Tobacco brands like Marlboro/Parliament vs. their competition. 

I know P/E multiples are worth jack shit - but it's a quick and dirty way to find relative market positioning, so let's do that. Their current stock price implies \~13x on fwd. P/E. This is a **\~30% discount** to the broader market - meaning: on P/E valuations, the overall market has left these guys behind in the recent run-up, even with the iQOS embedded growth story in the stock. What's this tell me? Their growth story hasn't been realized by the market.. yet. 

How about historically? Historically, they've traded at a \~9% discount to the broader market on a fwd. P/E basis, so even if PM were to align with their P/E's historical relationship with the wider market, there is still double digit upside here (30% discount up to 9% discount).

One more final kicker. Less than 5% of PM's revenues come from the U.S. - what's been happening recently? The dollar is weakening, GLD is becoming more &amp; more of a crowded trade. Their growth in iQOS, regardless of whether it comes from consumer usage in the U.S. or not, will be amplified by this dynamic. With their dividend yield - this will eventually cross the 'smart' money's eyes as a weakening dollar play. They make money in China, Europe, Japan, to name a few. 

\--------

**Quick Management Overview:**

Their CEO is this 62 year old Greek guy by the name of Andre Calantzopoulos &amp; got into the position of CEO in 2013. What interested me most about him was his background - Electrical Engineer with professional work experience in Robotics. This plus PM's shift to iQOS/tech-driven tobacco just makes sense under this guy &amp; makes me excited that PM's Board of Directors went with a visionary to be at the helm of a Company that screams old school. 

His comp plan, in addition to rest of the C-suite is based roughly [45% on Growth initiatives (Market Share, Net Revenues, Customer/Employee Satisfaction) &amp; the remaining 55% on Profit initiatives](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312520085906?cik=1413329). While on the surface, this may not seem to be the best comp structure to motivate a CEO to pursue extraordinary growth initiatives, the Profit part of his comp plan is built on $ values generated, &amp; not % margin growth. This is a 173 year old company with a supply chain that's hammered out probably most of its flaws, so margins as they are (\~40%+ Operating Income Margins historically) should be the ceiling. So how to grow this? Top line. Revenues.

Profit margins of 1.3%? I could sell used toilet paper and make higher margins than that

Growing debt as well, and obviously they are so desperate that they won’t even back out from their deal with a proven fraud

66,Disney is going to the god damn moon,technocrat_landlord,1601361149,"It's like... Imagine Netflix, but you have the best IP in the world and have been making the best content, profitably, for decades

And you can use the data about what people are streaming to cross-sell them on baby yoda dolls, theme park visits, cruises, etc etc

It's a company with some of, if not THE most valuable cinematic IP in the world, turning on a brand new revenue stream which simultaneously makes every other one of their revenue channels more valuable (due to targeted cross-selling based on streaming viewership) AND better informs them of the type of content to produce in the future

Apparently they told people they could stream Mulan for 29.99 and it increased subscribers by 68% over Labor Day weekend.

If Netflix told me I could stream a movie for 5 bucks I'd tell them to pound sand. And Netflix is losing some of Disney's IP soon

So let's look at market caps

Disney = 227B - https://ycharts.com/companies/DIS/market_cap

Netflix = 216B - https://ycharts.com/companies/NFLX/market_cap

Sure Disney's parks, cruises, etc, took a big hit from covid. but let's look at Disney+ again with 60 million subscribers, compared to Netflix's 180 million.

Now I think the average Disney+ subscriber (long term, they're practically giving it away ATM to drive growth) is more valuable than a Netflix subscriber, because of the cross-selling potential. But let's say they have the same value as a Netflix customer.

That would mean that, if Disney+ is valued the same way Netflix is (recurring revenue multiple, and even stickier due to kids programming IMO) it would account for almost 30% of Disney's market cap. Given that Disney is down about 15% still from pre-covid highs, that means that the rest of their legacy media business is only (roughly) 55% as valuable as before covid.

So you tell me, on a discounted cash flow basis, are all of Disney's combined legacy businesses worth about half of what they used to be? Or are people overlooking the insane firehose of money Disney+ is going to be, as well as the gross margins associated with it

Considering Disney normally profits from making this content already, the streaming revenue is just extra profit compared Netflix has to use debt to fund its content creation. And we know the types of gross margins are associated with streaming, and the multiples that wallstreet assigns to recurring revenue streams

For example if IV is 110% before earnings which are after close of day, will the IV fall immediately when the market opens the next morning at 9:30am? Or does it gradually go down through the morning? Because it might be another option to sell the OTM puts the morning after earnings before the IV falls.

You shuffle the crumpled receipt in your hands impatiently. Your glasses, affixed to the edge of your temple-embedded Neuralink®  data bay, reflect the crimson light of the daily S&amp;P 7, right as it turns green to the tune of a 1% EOD pump. This comes as no surprise to you, as the markets have been fixed at 1% since the Savior Act of 2024 -- wherein US citizens were deemed ""unfit"" to participate at will in the equities market, citing their obvious lack of self control and greed, and so a mandated 1% rise in value was to be made each day, ad infinum, regardless of intraday market performance (also synthetic). 

The thought of tomorrow excites you. Stimulus Week is here, and the new gov't stim package has arrived in your brokerage account: a fresh batch of 200 ITM SPY calls, which are guaranteed to print. Perhaps you will short them and yolo into TSLA calls at the top again. Life feels rather meaningless now that only 7 companies remain in the country and every body has been hooked to economic life support while they waste away and get utilized as data processors for the Big 7. 

You glance at the clock. 4:20. Nice.

The cold Pacific water reflects into the 3rd floor windows. You stare back. You dream of running away, leaving it all behind and starting over in British Columbia, anything, anywhere, as long as it meant you could feel something again. Anything. You hear a loud THUD, and recoil. A package has been dropped by the interior server drones, it is your complimentary 37% THC Indica dominant 5 gram pre-roll for purchasing your 10th latte this week! You smoke it, order another latte, and forget why you were staring out the window. Next thing you know, you're on 14th street eating a hamburger.

Life can be strange these days.

80,FOOLPROOF OPTIONS STRATEGY MUST READ,Diamondhands69,1601357784,"Greetings fellow autists.

I believe I have developed a truly exceptional options trading strategy that I just wanted to share.

Each night before I cuddle up in bed next to my wife’s boyfriend I scoop my cats litter box. 

The key here is at the start of each day I randomly pick two mighty tech stocks. One for the left side, one for the right. 

When I scoop my cats dung at the end of the day, the side they pooped in determines the company, the number of shots determines direction. 

Example: today was left side appl, right side msft. Cat shit on the left side twice, therefore puts on appl.

I’ve called this strategy LITTERPICKER 2.0. And my cats daily shit picks can be yours for just 99.99 a month.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j1t9al/foolproof_options_strategy_must_read/

Puerto just put a law in place which mandates that 40% of all electricity must be obtained from renewable energy sources. So they will need to go from 2.3% to 40% energy generation from renewables in the next five years.... to do that, obviously more renewable energy projects will need to be built, and quickly. So far, 16 different projects have been submitted to PREPA and Montalva is the largest and most efficient, by far, of any of them. The company is currently only listed in Canada on the TSX-V exchange but is in the process of applying for a NASDAQ listing.

21,"$SABR: A cheap, low-risk coronavirus travel recovery play",exposethetruth123,1601351857,"Most of my ""investing"" experience thus far has consisted of YOLOing into far OTM calls on shitty biotechs, so my apologies if something is missing. It's pretty obvious that the coronavirus recovery represents a significant buying opportunity, and there are two popular ways of playing this. The first - vaccine stocks - is extremely risky (as we saw with $INO today), and premium is quite expensive. The second is travel, and this usually means airline/cruise stocks. However, there is always the underlying risk of bankruptcy for these companies, and the premium isn't cheap either. If you're poor like me, you'll be looking for a more affordable way to play the recovery.

**Introduction**

Enter Sabre ($SABR). Sabre is a large global distributions systems company, which is ""used by travel agents and companies around the world to search, price, book, and ticket travel services provided by airlines, hotels, car rental companies, rail providers and tour operators"". With connections to over 70 airlines and 100,000 hotels, Sabre is deeply intertwined with the travel industry as a whole. This means that the stock price crashed as a result of COVID, dropping from $22 to $3. Sabre **is** the travel industry, and a recovery in the industry after the pandemic is over will lead to an increase in share price.

**Affordability**

The main advantage of SABR over other coronavirus plays is how damn cheap it is. Shares are trading just below $7 right now, but more importantly, *options are incredibly cheap.* Recall that the share price was $23 before COVID, and the stock has held between $20-$30 for years. With that in mind, a call option with a strike price of $15 with an expiry date of **January 2022** is only $135. It is extremely unlikely that there is not some degree of recovery in the travel industry by 2022, so calls should have absolutely no issue printing.

**Risks**

As with most travel companies, bankruptcy is a significant risk during the pandemic. However, at the end of Q2 2020, SABR had $1.3 billion cash on hand. During the same quarter, the company had a net loss of $400 million. Remember that Q2 (3/30 - 6/30) was during the height of COVID restrictions, especially with regards to travel. No one was flying then, and Sabre made $83 million. So, the $400 million loss is likely a worst-case scenario, meaning that Sabre has **at minimum** 3 quarters of cash on hand (1.3 billion/400 million), and likely significantly more. Anecdotally, the company has 59 job listings on their careers website - why would a nearly bankrupt company be recruiting for nearly 60 positions? The other primary risk is competition, but there are only three large global distribution systems companies in existence, and Sabre seems to be the largest. Overall, Sabre offers a unique opportunity to play the coronavirus recovery with minimal risk.

so that's $5 for a spread that'll be worth $10 if the stock maintains $115. If it loses money in the next week or two and you wanna exit for a loss, you can. If the stock rockets and you make 50% profit in the next week, you can take the money and run. If earning disappoint, you've at least got a week to exit somewhat gracefully. A moderate loss instead of a total loss.

I have 10, so that's $5k which with some luck will become $10k. I know that's not 'how would i turn $8 into $40million?' but trussssss me daddy, doubling up will make you rich. Just think:

5k becomes 10k becomes 20k becomes 40k becomes 80k becomes 160k. **that's 5 trades to turn 5 grand into 180 grand.**

i'll post my positions if people care. I assume you dont.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j1r92x/doubling_up_aapl/

My question is: is it best to sell calls of INO 13c exp 10/2 against my call contracts to collect some premium.

What is my risk exposure if INO let’s say rockets and passes 13$ before 10/2? Would the time remaining between 10/9 and 10/2 be enough to provide some gain? How would you calculate the remaining time value ?

Is this generally a good strategy to sell short term calls against long term (6months out) LEAP on the same strike price for OTM? Or no?

It’s still thirty fucking thousand. Tesla is going to hit $30,000/share by next week, and that’s the minimum. I pulled out by WSB ruler and measured it’s max potential. Guess what it is?

41,Elections Play - ICLN,reeses4brkfst,1601337280,"Alright guys, elections are &lt;40 days out and the big debate is tomorrow. Investors are going to start paying attention to polls and the speculative betting will commence. The ticker? ICLN.

ICLN is a market-cap-weighted index of the 30 most liquid businesses in clean energy. It's been getting a boost recently with the markets going green + battery day and other good news for the industry the last few days. It's up 6.4%in the last week and It just passed its 52wk high! Smaller game than usual around here (2mil avg volume, 1.47B market cap), but not a problem at all. The market clearly has room for long-term growth is all.

So what's the play?

See, Biden is going to poll better than Trump. He already is. Bidens energy policy includes a plan to make the US economy 100% clean with net-negative carbon emissions by 2050. He's also promising $1.7 trillion over the next 10yrs and more than $5 trillion total through private and state/local investments to make this happen. If Biden wins, this ETF gets a $5 trillion boost!

Now we all know it's more complicated than that and campaign promises usually fall short, but that's the beauty of this play. It's on speculation. Sell your calls before elections and it doesn't matter who wins. As long as Biden looks like he's winning, we're printing.

Now for the actual calls, I'd say $18, $19 or $20 11/20 calls. 

There is admittedly low volume on these calls. In fact, the $20 strike is 0.01 right now due to zero volume. But, there is volume on the others, all under a dollar per contract, and when the algos pick this up, there will be volume. 

I'm thinking ICLN could continue to climb on good news for the markets and elections speculation. There may be a dip, but I don't think this is done moving. Volatility is still low which means it's profitable to get in soon. If Biden does well tomorrow then it will probably spike again.

""The symbol of all relationships among [rational] men, the moral symbol of respect for human beings, is the trader. We, who live by values, not by loot, are traders, both in matter and in spirit. A trader is a man who earns what he gets and does not give or take the undeserved. A trader does not ask to be paid for his failures, nor does he ask to be loved for his flaws. A trader does not squander his body as fodder or his soul as alms. Just as he does not give his work except in trade for material values, so he does not give the values of his spirit — his love, his friendship, his esteem — except in payment and in trade for human virtues, in payment for his own selfish pleasure, which he receives from men he can respect. The mystic parasites who have, throughout the ages, reviled the traders and held them in contempt, while honoring the beggars and the looters, have known the secret motive of their sneers: a trader is the entity they dread — a man of justice.""

 **Posted:** **SEP 28, 2020 / 05:17 PM CDT** **|** **Updated:** **SEP 28, 2020 / 06:02 PM CDT** 

 

([NewsNation Now](http://newsnationnow.com/)) — Having trouble logging in to Microsoft Teams or Outlook 365?

Users of several different Microsoft services including Outlook and Teams reported problems Monday afternoon, according to website [Downdetector.com](https://downdetector.com/status/office-365/).

The outage is affecting users across the country.

“We’re investigating an issue affecting access to multiple Microsoft 365 services. We’re working to identify the full impact and will provide more information shortly,” Microsoft [said in a tweet](https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1310696819135901696).

Microsoft followed up in a tweet saying in part, “We’ve identified a recent change that appears to be the source of the issue. We’re rolling back the change to mitigate impact,” then tweeted that after that change, they are “not observing an increase in successful connections.” Microsoft says they are now “working to evaluate additional mitigation solutions while we investigate the root cause.”

The company’s tweet directs affected users to the site [status.office.com](https://status.office.com/) for updates, which currently advises, “Existing sessions do not appear to be affected. Affected users are encouraged to keep existing sessions going and to avoid re-authenticating to Microsoft 365 services.”

The affected products include Office 365, Outlook, Teams, Azure, OneDrive and SharePoint; according to status.office.com, “Any Microsoft 365 service that leverages Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication may be impacted by this issue.”

ZM is currently trading at 8x value from the start of the year and 2020 Y/Y revenue has increased only 1.9x. $500 is a nice round number, maybe I should buy some ZM puts?

Low and behold, CEO yuan eric sold a whopping $69 million of ZM stock on 9/23 and 9/24 (reported on 9/25 after hours) and currently holds zero shares:

Like holy crap, if I owned ZM I'd sell it all too at this price level. Who wants to work hard to grow a company when you can cash in and retire on a cool $69 million? MRNA had a similar situation and sold off 35% from 7/17 to 9/2. Huge bear signal. I bet ZM fully fills the gap to $325 within two months.

Why is 100x revenue a lot? NVDA is trading at 22x revenue and AAPL at 7x revenue, and both of these companies are blue chips that are more profitable and have, in my opinion, much better long term growth potential (AI revolution gonna be huge, AAPL and NVDA to the moon). 

Also ZM isn't the only company that provides peer to peer voice call service. Did you know that MSFT owns skype? AAPL owns facetime, AMZN owns twitch, and many other companies compete with zoom.

Lastly, Trump announced live today near close that rapid corona virus test kits are rolling out soon, with results available in minutes, and the vaccine is on verge of phase 3 approval. Be sure to spread the word, gl.

80,Easy steps to becoming a TA Buff,Bezosismydaddy,1601330913,"Hey tards. This is the first in a series of posts to help you beef up your TA. I see too many new traders just place bets based on their gut, instead of taking two seconds to learn the basics of technical analysis. I know it can be difficult since, after all, TA can be very technical and you guys can't even book a hooker without getting confused by all the numbers. But I'm here to make it a little easier for you. Then subject of this post will be to give you the very basics, and we'll work our way up to more complicated and advanced theories.

I think a lot of the basics can be boiled down to some infographics that get the core concepts across. I've done the work for you and compiled a treasure trove of TA guides that should help take your portfolios to the moon. Thank me when you are rich. 

Start off (this is the easy part) by learning the basic patterns.

Next, you'll have to study what they mean. This will take some time, but trust me, it'll be worth it.

Northwest pipe has a monopoly on the water transmission pipe industry.  This is the way to play water shortage.

This is a profitable company with a PE ratio of 8 (before today).  The industry average is 22 or 30 or some shit.  This stock should be at 40 or 50.  There’s no volume on options so you Robinhood poors can move along.

83,iPhone 12 is a bigger deal than anyone realizes: how to time your play,IronBlock,1601330639,"I’ll keep it brief.

#Why is it a big deal?

American home Internet is garbage. Even if you want your ISP to come upgrade your shit because your entire family is on zoom and Netflix 24/7, good luck. Long waits, and if you need a new modem to get the faster speeds, you may as well just walk out into traffic.

#Who gives a shit about the iPhone?
Lots of people. It’s popular, and Joe and Stacy Sixpack aren’t switching to a 5G Android miPhone off AliExpress just because some neckbeard in their orbit is reeeing about muh Open Sores.

#Why would anyone buy a $1500 fashion accessory during a pandemic?
5G is pretty fast. Unlimited data is pretty cheap. Most carriers can enable it from their website. Daddy is getting the new iPhone so he can tether his laptop and watch myfreecams while mommy has a “one on one” with her boyfriend. Meanwhile, their eight kids can watch YouTube. Nobody buffering, domestic harmony restored.

#Shut up and tell me how to make money off this
Apple is notoriously fussy about presentation dates. They’re pretty easy to predict, even without leaks.

Invitations go out Oct 1 for an event on Oct 13 or Oct 8 for an event on Oct 20, preorders on Oct 16 or Oct 23 so they can announce numbers during Oct 28 earnings call.

Based on how dicked down they got last time the exact microsecond Tim said “this event is about the iPad and the Watch”, expect the hype to be absolutely uncontainable this time - there’s no doubts, and we might see the first ARM Macs too.

5,"Market and Options Summary for September 28th, 2020 -",NoeticOptions,1601326705,"## Daily Synopsis 

* The S&amp;P 500 increased +1.66% today while the NASDaq added (+2.01%). The Russell 2000 rose by (+2.47%). The Dow ended in positive territory at (+1.55%)
* All sectors ended in positive territory today. The best performing sector was Financials(+2.38%) while Utilities(+0.26%)was the worst performer.
* Analyst upgrades, M&amp;A activity, and another positive vaccine update from Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ 147.11, +1.45, +1.0%) were corporate-related drivers of sentiment for many cyclical stocks. Other positive factors were House Speaker Pelosi saying a stimulus bill is still possible and quarter-end rebalancing, which favored the financial and energy sectors. 
* A separate viewpoint was rooted more in technical observation than news. The lack of volatility, and market-moving events, suggested today was a momentum trade from Friday, with performance aided by a recognition the S&amp;P 500 and Dow had declined for four straight weeks. 
* U.S. Treasuries were stagnant during today's stock market gains. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield was unchanged at 0.66%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.4% to 94.27. WTI crude futures rose 0.7%, or $0.29, to $40.54/bbl.
* Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September, the S&amp;P Case-Shiller Home Price Index for July, and the Advance August reports for Intl Trade in Goods, Retail Inventories, and Wholesale Inventories will be released on Tuesday.

Owning Bachman, Zapp's, Dirty, Golden Flake, Good Health, Snikiddy, Boulder Canyon, TGI Fridays Snacks and TORTIYAHS! , buying into Utz allows you to reach every obese American throughout the country.

Earnings are coming December 9th, and they always post revenue in the high millions.

UH ass has released a statement basicallySaying that they are still providing safe and effective care of that patient data has been compromised. Both of these statements are likely false. As the computers stay down for a prolonged period of time, they’ll divert more and more patients and lose more revenue. Additionally, the media blow back once it hits main stream news will likely cause further decline. It’s only down slightly more than 1% at this time but I think it can drop a lot more once it gets more coverage.
I bought October puts, but I would’ve like to buy November puts because then you can also bet on Biden getting elected and UHS dropping on that as well, but November puts are expensive.

1. a stock that fallen during the pandemic, and will recover later.
2. an option with a reasonable implied volatility, otherwise it will be too expansive

The first things come to mind is : 
1. airlines (they already gained half of what the lost), and very volotile
2. cruise lines, the same as airlines
3. moderna/pfirzer .. probably overinflated, and even if the vaccine will work, it is already priced in

3,"SPCE Update #1 - Welcome to the land of tendies, but remain cautious",Mystical_Playz,1601319045,"Last week, I created a bullish [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iyfo0p/attention_all_those_who_lost_money_on_tesla_and/) on SPCE to help those who nearly lost it all due to TSLA and VALE. 

I said I would follow up every Friday, but since the stock is up 20+% as of right now, I have decided to share some more guidance. 

&amp;#x200B;

For me, this is one of the few green days I've seen on my account in a while, and the diamond hands are kicking in. But, being an experienced trader now, I have learned I can't greed too much. 

So what's the plan? Close out some profits and ride the rocket for free. If you bought calls or bull spreads (or sold puts for whatever reason), chances are you're up anywhere from 150% to 300% right now (my call debit spreads are up 200%). 

In order to keep money for future all-ins, I recommend closing 20-30% of your SPCE positions. If you have 1 position, keep it. If you have 2, feel free to decide whether or not to sell one. If you have more, use the %ages as guidance for how much to sell. Or don't, not my money. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take a look at tomorrow's possibilities:

First, let's use a key fundamental I have learned: the stock price will go up or down.

Possibility #1 (49.9%):

SPCE goes up: In this case, SPCE will go up. This is good; everyone is hopping onto the hype train. For every % SPCE goes up, close that % times 2 of your current remaining SPCE positions. For example, SPCE goes up 5%, so close 10% of your remaining positions on Tuesday.  

Possibility #2 (49.91%): 

SPCE goes down: In this case, SPCE will go down. This looks bad at first, but is not that bad. This will probably be from a sell-off, as people who bought in earlier today sell in order to secure quick profits. Do the opposite of what you would do if it goes up. Increase your position by 2x the % it drops (goes down 5% = increase 10%). I recommend avoiding anything above $26 and before 10/23 (but its your money, your choice - what do I know). 

Possibility #3 (0.18%):

SPCE remains relatively flat only going up or down +- 2 or 3%. In this case, its really worth to modify your positions but feel free to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some quotes to make you feel better through confirmation bias:

"" Bank of America analyst Ronald Epstein set a $35 price target, more than double Virgin Galactic’s closing price on Friday. He said that while the company isn’t yet operational, it’s unique because it has nearly full vertical integration by building, assembling and operating aircraft ""

"" Earlier this month, Credit Suisse reinstated coverage of Virgin Galactic with an outperform rating on prospects for its first commercial sub-orbital flight next year. ""

(from  [https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/virgin-galactic-soars-as-analysts-tout-space-tourism-potential/ar-BB19vrgX](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/virgin-galactic-soars-as-analysts-tout-space-tourism-potential/ar-BB19vrgX)). 

I would find more but I'm lazy. Let's ride until the launch. Buckle in. Or strap a rocket on your back. Either works. Launch on 10/22 (if it doesn't get delayed). 

I probably won't post again until next Monday 10/5 unless we see a +- 20+% move again. 

Good luck!

75,WSTL Share Consolidation Play,muddywaters146,1601312250,"Westell Technologies, Inc. (WSTL) is consolidating their shares in a 1 for 1000 reverse stock split, subject to shareholder approval at their AGM on September 29, 2020.

According to their DEF 14A filed on August 11, 2020, shareholders owning less than 1000 shares will be cashed out at 1.48 per share, representing a 24% premium to the current share price of 1.19 and potential maximum upside of $289.71 if 999 shares are purchased. If you own 1000 or greater shares you will not be cashed out.

Given high voting power by the directors of the company (53%), the transaction has a high chance of going through. In the event of the vote not going through, I view the downside as limited given large amounts of cash on the balance sheet (net debt of $17.7m vrs market cap of $18.8m).

DD:

""Stockholders owning fewer than 1,000 shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split, whom we refer to as “Cashed Out Stockholders,” will receive $1.48 in cash, without interest, for each share held at the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split (the “effective time”), and they will no longer be stockholders of the Company.""

"" The shares of Class B Common Stock held by our directors comprise approximately 53% of the voting power of our common stock. The directors and executive officers have each indicated that they intend to vote all of the shares of our common stock held by them (592,222 shares of Class A Common Stock and all shares of Class B Common Stock) “FOR” the Transaction. As a result of this holding, the Transaction is expected to be approved. ""

3,Callaway Golf (ELY) Should Blow Out Earnings Estimates - DD,TP_Killem,1601309554,"Early COVID lockdowns shut down golf courses, causing a huge dip in rounds played and equipment sales back in March to May.  Since then, players have returned to golf at unprecedented levels, with rounds played up 14% YoY in June and up 20% YoY for July and August (August numbers were released this weekend).  ELY posted big losses for its FQ2 of April to June, but Callaway noted at the time that sales were bouncing back, [with June equipment sales up 20% over 2019](https://ir.callawaygolf.com/static-files/66a83bcc-6e98-4b76-b2cf-ca77e47f242e).  Golf rounds played have only continued to grow compared to 2019 over the past two months and [searches for the company over the past months have been far above any point over the last five years.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F06m028) 

The Callaway (ELY) FQ3 is from July to September.  Rounds played over this period will be up comfortably higher than in June, when Callaway's sales popped 20% compared to 2019.  Dick's sporting goods noted in its late August [earnings call for May to July](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/26/dicks-sporting-goods-inc-dks-q2-2020-earnings-call/) that the ""golf business has been great ...  The golf season is being extended with what's going on right now with the playoffs and the PGA Tour, followed by the US Open in September and then the Masters in November.

22,The importance of a moat in tech stocks,aelaos1,1601307471,"tldr; sell NET (but not immediate PUTS)

Technology companies and startups can be very good plays in uncertain times. I am a firm believer of the Silicon Valley mantra “Software will eat the world” famously [said](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/) by Ben Horowitz in 2011. Furthermore, AI and other revolutionary tech will have its share at the pie. But there are clear differences in these companies and what another famous investor Buffet likes to say is that he doesn’t buy companies without a moat. But what is a moat in this context?

#### What’s a moat in tech?

&gt;The term [economic moat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicmoat.asp), popularized by [Warren Buffett](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/071801.asp), refers to a business’ ability to maintain competitive advantages over its competitors in order to protect its long-term profits and [market share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketshare.asp) from competing firms. Just like a medieval castle, the moat serves to protect those inside the fortress and their riches from outsiders.  
Investopedia

Translated to the software world it means that the product has the users locked in due to either network effects, a unique selling point or both. An example of that is Facebook. At the start its moat was weak but now it has all the users locked in because of the network effects that it’s pointless to build something else as a competitor. Another example is my favorite tech stock: **GOOG** which is a cliche but it fits all the criteria. They didn’t have a network effect because they provided a service to the end customer. But their unique selling points were so strong and their tech was so ahead of the other competitors that they took over the market. So what I am really saying is that it’s prudent to avoid tech stocks without a moat.

#### Cloudflare (NET) as an example

Given I have a fairly good technical background in software this is a company that I admit I bought but I will sell after actually trying to use their product. What [Cloudflare](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/net) (**NET**) is selling is an edge Content Delivery Network (CDN) that quite a few companies use. But their flagship product as a CDN is widely available in other providers and for free. Their client lock in is essentially non-existent because at whatever point in time someone can just copy paste the content into another provider and her business will run uninterrupted. There is no vendor lock in, no moat.

Getting more technical, check out the site that most developers use to build web applications: [React Documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment). If you go to the deployment section you can see a gazillion of competitors that offer more or less the same services. Yes Cloudflare has a stable and good business with DDOS attacks and may have a little bit better speed but their product can be very easily disrupted by the next startup that goes out of Y Combinator or any other cloud provider including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Netlify etc. In other words, this stock can go out of business and has a higher risk of ruin.

46,Capital Efficiency Theory,WarrenFugit,1601305156,"Okay so when Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger say they never owned more than 3 stocks to get rich but warren had/has one stock (Coke) and Charlie had 2 (Bank of America &amp; Wells Fargo) in their personal portfolios. their take on diversification is, its for idiots. Because a really good business is well protected from the bear markets and competition over the long term. Basically one good company that you understand everything about. I get what hes saying but to me it feels alot like an ""all in"" or a ""yolo"" play to me. But I also understand that investing $10,000 into 50 companies (some you dont fully understand) is worse than, and you wont make as much profit if you were to put that same $10,000 into 1 good company you completely understand and like.

Side note:
Warren did use to say no more than 7 when he was younger, then started saying no more than 3 when he got older. But he personally recommends less than 3 EXTREMLY good companies and he personally only invests in ONE.

Another side note:
They say you lose capital efficiency when you go past 13 different companies, that you could’ve compounded money into less and better company’s making you more money over time. Warren thinks you lose capital efficiency with more than 1 and munger thinks more than 3 your losing capital effefficiency. They also say that the finance institutions are basing their curriculum not to get you rich but to maintain decent growth and protect your money. But as an argument to that, you are protected because a really good company just has the market in their palms and the other competitors will only get a small slice of the pie. And they also say when that “huge dip” is inevitable it gives them a better buying and return opportunity than someone that is buying into a lot of different companies.

Last side note:
You have companies like Amazon who if the e commerce industry were to burst or go to shit they have other business ventures to fall back on for revenue like Amazon prime, twitch, etc which would make them broader and better investing opportunities than some other blue chip companies that might not have those assets.

Last thing:
Mark Cuban says the same thing saying diversification is for people that don’t know what they are investing in.

Just trying to see you guys’ take on that, im also wanting to figure out how I can calculate capital efficiency. Aka the “sweet spot”


Conclusion:
If you are very sure of a company, so sure that you would invest half of your life plus into that single company. Then yes, but they would have to be the biggest in their industry, no chance of competition. You need to fully understand their business model inside and out, how they got to be where they are “did they change or innovate in order to get there?” And “how are they positioned for the (contactless) future, you need to know EVERYTHING about their financials, understand and compare past growth to other companies. Andddd, they should have other assets to fall back on if their primary business were to fail. Then yes, it could be a great investment. Side note, when that one company eventually drops hard you’ll have a better buying and profit opportunity putting all your money in that one company, than you would have if you invested into a lot of different companies.

TL;DR: better companies = better investments, less companies = calculated investments and more profits. 
(Still don’t know if I want to yolo into 1 company tho)

Morgan Stanley upgrades Plug Power to Overweight on rapid growth potential As previously reported, Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd upgraded Plug Power to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $14, up from $10.25, following the company's investor day symposium. The event highlighted upside potential from several areas, including fuel cell vehicle sales to Linde, the Apex partnership to secure cheap U.S. renewable power, ""several avenues of growth"" in Europe, and Plug's strong progress in electrolyzer technology, according to Byrd, who now factors in a higher long-term growth rate for Plug Power.

81,Should we make a chaotic Hedge Fund?,CCLyolo,1601300702,"Hello!

I was thinking of an idea where we make a giant unregulated, completely f**ked up hedge fund designed to do whatever its unitholders decide they want it to do via a voting process, options permitted (no stupid performance fees etc..).

People buy into it via a creative ICO, and they use the coins as voting units/equity,  coins can get redeemed for $ with some form of legal structure to prove ownership and assets (lots of this TBD, it would need to be provable that no company, individual or government can steal or seize assets). 

Basically if a large majority decides this week we are yoloing into far out TSLA calls, that's what happens. If we decide we are tanking company XYZ by shorting them to oblivion that's what happens.

We would/could completely fuck up the markets in an even more advanced way than we currently are, and we might even profit. It would be loads of fun seeing an evil companies stock tank because they did a dick move that we don't like. Or see a good company get access to all the $ they need because we decided to buy their junk bonds.

For its vision and research and development, I think Tesla will front and centre in this new future of ours. Their ability and willingness to open source innovations is a testament to their commitment but also says that they feel comfortable in leading (not threatened).

There will be a few competitors for sure on all fronts interns of style and cost, but the 25k car combined with enhanced autopilot and overall safety, will allow Tesla to outpace others at least in the short-term (next 5 years).

All this to say, I want to be able to partake in their success in the form of OTM leaps at least a year and a bit out.

9,My mom is a better trader than me (up 500% vs down 98%),htotheizzostocks,1601295718,"Hello guys, I was telling my mom about robinhood and shit and she managed to profit even through the september crash. 

She told me to invest in Peidmont lithium because lithium is the future of the world and they are the nicest ecologically when it comes to Lithium bla bla. i kinda blew her off and by the time i realized she was right it already ran up 30%. however my lithium is up 200%, it's just an extremely small investment to be on the same team as my mom, feels really stupid to have my only profitable stonk be my smallest investment.

I lost 10 grand on Tesla calls (and $140,000 total) and she's up 500+% now on her Lithium investment. Am I a complete retard? She literally called that Piedmont Lithium would work with Tesla.. wtf

 She doesn't even know how to sell, like at all, maybe that's her skill? My soggy potato chip hands have costed me so much money. I'll attach two screenshots, her telling me about the Lithium and also her next play (seriously). She's 68 years old. 

It's her birthday on October so I would love to surprise her by not being a disappointment but let's be honest, that's not possible. She has literally zero idea how much money I lost on this dumb phone app, meanwhile she watches CNN and struggles to sell and is destroying the market...

18,Quick explainer on DXY before you all get excited,learningtosail,1601294484,"There's a lot of dollar chatter in the daily and I thought I would give a quick explanation.  

TLDR dxy is a stupid indicator and you should ignore it  

The DXY was introduced at the time of Bretton woods and the weighting is as such:  

* [Euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro) (EUR),            57.6% weight
* [Japanese yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen) (JPY)     13.6% weight
* [Pound sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling) (GBP),  11.9% weight
* [Canadian dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar) (CAD), 9.1% weight
* [Swedish krona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_krona) (SEK),   4.2% weight
* [Swiss franc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_franc) (CHF)      3.6% weight  

The only update since bretton woods was simply to combine several original european currencies into the euro and adding up their weightings arriving at 57.6%, no other changes have been made.  

So the DXY is therefore 75% what goes on in the european subcontinent currency space, with some Yen thrown in (safe haven currency) and CAD (commodities).  

This is clearly a terrible reflection of the value of the dollar. Where is gold? Where is China? Being heavily European makes sense but not to 57.6%. The EuroZone GDP \~\~ China and the European subcontinent GDP \~\~ us GDP, with EU international trade &gt; us trade. (2019 numbers) . Global gold value is approximately the GDP of China, with China making up \~14tln to the us \~21tln (2019). Any sensible model including CNY and a properly weigthed balance of middle-size economies (AUD, MEX anyone?) on a trade or GDP basis paints a very different picture to DXY.  

In summary, if you are watching DXY you might as well just watch EURUSD. If you actually want to try and value the dollar it is much more complicated but also more informative.  

  

As a note on the ""reserve status"" question: Dollars are not held as reserves per se, mostly longer duration treasuries are held. Actual dollars are used to settle trade balances, with surpluses being recycled through bond purchases into reserves or lending cash to other countries / businesses in dollars. It is not in principle difficult to settle trade balances with other 'stores of value'. For example, China has a deal with russia to settle commodities trades with notional gold transfers (held in Shanghai) and has a potential deal with Iran allowing trade to be settled with ""soft currency"" like Thai Baht if China wants to. The EU had a deal with Iran to settle trade using a literal barter system in order to preserve the Iran Nuclear Deal without getting sanctioned, although it eventually collapsed.

  A lot of people have been saying ""there's no alternative"" but that's bullshit. Settling trade isn't rocket science. Saudi, Switzerland and Norway are using us equities as sovereign wealth funds/reserves.  

The ""reserve status"" isn't propped up by the trading system (although it helps), it is propped up by the network of dollar-debt assets and liabilities held by basically every business and government in the world. Everyone therefore has an incentive for that not to break down, but once it starts to look like the ship *could* sink, everyone will want to get off ASAP to not be left bagholding assets in a devalued currency and then it *definitely will sink.*  

**This is not a prediction with a date assigned to it by the way. It is a certainty that it will eventually happen sometime in the infinite future, but it may not happen this cycle or even this generation.** So don't get too excited about it. As long as you are investing in options and stonks it probably shouldn't bother you because equities will inflate.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j1aoqe/quick_explainer_on_dxy_before_you_all_get_excited/

24,My thoughts,blues_for_allah,1601292534,"Inflation isn't coming until the FED goes from ""lending powers"" to ""spending power"".
QE is NOT money printing. We are about to have a massive deflationary event. 

The FED, through QE, creates reserves on behalf of the banks in exchange for debt. Member banks use their own liquidity to buy debt. That debt is then ""sold"" to the FED but instead of giving the ""money"" to the banks, they place it in reserves on behalf of the bank. Those reserves are NOT legal tender. They cannot be spent!

Even when corporate bonds wind up on the FED's balance sheet, they still have to be serviced! It's not like the FED forgives the debt. So this idea that corporations or the government is getting money created out of thin air is ridiculous. Reserves are created out of thin air. Money is lent into existence. Even those credit facilities are loans using special purpose vehicles designed to bypass primary dealers. 

The FED does not have the power to spend directly into the economy. Powell mentioned this the other day. The FED can only create reserves to be lent against. If there is no lending, in excess of repayment, there is no money being created. Money is destroyed when loans are repaid. In a debt based economy, debt must expand beyond repayment for ""growth"" to occur. 

When we borrow, money is created in the economy, when the government borrows, they do so from existing dollars, thereby shrinking the amount of liquidity in the system. That is deflationary. QE is deflationary (see the link below from the St. Louis Fed).

50,Profound Medical Corporation,TOSmysalad,1601277796,"Since option trading of this stock has only just recently begun, I thought now would be a good time to share this company with this sub. 

Profound Medical Corporation (NASDAQ: PROF)(TSX: PRN) is a medical device company with two devices currently on the market. The first is called Sonalleve and is used to treat uterine fibroids. I won’t touch on this device much, as it only represents a fraction of this company’s potential. 

Their other device is called the TULSA-PRO (Transurethral ULtraSound Ablation of the PROstate) and it’s used to treat prostate cancer. How it works is the TULSA goes up the urethra and through real-time MRI the doctors can see exactly where the cancer is on the prostate, and by using ultrasound transducers the device will heat up to the point where it causes cellular death only to the specific area of the prostate that contains cancer tissue. 

This [link](https://viturohealth.com/tulsapro-landing-page/what-is-tulsa-pro-treatment/) provides a nice diagram of what the procedure looks like, as well as a brief description of the difference between the TULSA and it’s competitor HIFU, which performs a similar function but through the rectum and can cause damage to the rectal wall. Whereas the TULSA employs cooling to the area to prevent any damage to healthy tissue. 

As you can see from the diagram in the above link, TULSA-PRO cools the surrounding area through the transurethral device and a separate endorectal cooling device. 

Basically, the TULSA-PRO is the gayest shit ever and I thought this sub would love to hear about a sounding device that cures cancer and gives your bum a cool little tickle while it’s at it. If you don’t know what sounding is, I don’t recommend looking up the subreddit, you might not like it. 

Now a little about the present and future of the company. Currently they have seven TULSA devices in Germany, one in Japan, five in the U.S. including the Mayo Clinic and most recently UT Southwestern Medical Center. One site in LA ran by a radiology company called RadNet is currently not operational due to the pandemic. 

Given that hospitals are busy dealing with a pandemic, this year Profound has been primarily targeting radiology centres as clients for sale or rental of their device, as well as focusing on adding their device in more teaching hospitals. Profound has sold a few of their devices, but their preferred business model is to rent the devices for recurring revenue. The company expects to have four more installations by the year’s end. 

The company has piqued the interest of several hedge funds and analysts, although venture capital and private equity firms only make up about 7% of ownership, whereas institutional investors make up close to 40%, leaving only 19.4 million shares outstanding. Part of the reason for the low amount of available shares is the reverse split the company performed last year in order to uplist to the NASDAQ. 
 
Reading what the analysts have said about the company gets my dick hard. And if you’ve had the TULSA procedure, there’s an 83% chance you can maintain erections sufficient enough for penetration too. 

Analysts have been quite positive about the future of Profound. Most notably is what the [Raymond James](https://www.cantechletter.com/2020/08/the-skys-the-limit-for-profound-medical-says-raymond-james/) analyst said last year, expecting revenue of $28 million next year and $55 million by 2022, and just recently a [Jeffries](https://biotuesdays.com/2020/09/15/jefferies-starts-profound-medical-at-buy-pt-31-canadian/) analyst wrote he expects self-pay revenue of $100 million dollars by 2024. 

Which leads me to the topic of revenue models. The model Profound is working with now is a purely cash-paying model without insurance. Insurance coverage is expected to be a few years away, as the company might have to apply for a new insurance code for their device to fall under. As per their last conference call, they currently charge $7,710 CAD per procedure, and the hospital or clinic charges around the same for a total cost to the patient of about $15,000. Which isn’t a lot of money to save you from getting your ass cut up which has a higher risk of erectile disfunction and loss of bladder control. 

Since only a few procedures are happening at the moment, the company said they are targeting potential patients that have the most to gain from using the TULSA, meaning men that will likely have negative outcomes from surgery and other cancer treatments. But as the Jeffries analyst wrote, moving forward TULSA will be a great candidate for men that have cancer in the early stages that are too small to operate on, which makes up 600,000 men annually in the U.S. alone. The Jeffries analyst projects by 2024 they will have over 6,000 procedures being performed that year. 

Now again this is on a cash model, and if insurance kicks in this will be a different story. Over the past couple months I have been buying this stock aggressively, as there is a chance the TULSA-PRO could fall under existing coding, saving a couple years of the process it takes for a new medical device to be covered under insurance. Then it will be a matter of the company producing enough device. The Jeffries analyst projects the TULSA to be in 125 sites in the U.S. by 2024 using the cash model. 

Last July Profound made a public offering of their shares at $14.50 USD and they raised $50 million dollars, which doubled their cash on hand, and they aren’t sitting on a lot of debt. They just hired more than a dozen new staff, but I would imagine they need the cash to produce more devices. Unfortunately they didn’t touch on what the purpose of the public offering was in their last earnings call, which took place just after the public offering. 

As I mentioned above, Profound has a second device called Sonalleve that treats uterine fibroids using the same technology as the TULSA-PRO. Uterine fibroids is a common condition among women, but not many women need to have them operated on and some may not even know the benign cysts are there. This device definitely has potential to generate a lot of revenue, but not nearly to the scale as the TULSA-PRO. 

The fact that Profound has found two uses for their technology is encouraging to growing future of the company. Last [quarter](https://profoundmedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PROFOUND-MEDICAL-CORP-Q2-2020-FINAL.pdf) they spent over $2 million in R&amp;D, and it makes me wonder if they are looking into other treatments for their technology. I consulted a friend of mine that’s a specialist about the potential uses for this technology, and he suggested rectal cancer, colon cancer or any gastrointestinal cancer, as well as voice box cancer, and even using the ablation technology for genital herpes and warts. Of course this is all merely speculation on my part, but it does seem like there is a bit of a possibility for other uses of this technology. 

I’m long on this stock, since it has left me wondering how long until they have given the TULSA procedure to 130,000 men, resulting in over a billion dollars in revenue. I would imagine they would be bought out before that happens.

65,S&amp;P500 Technical Analysis &amp; Chart Breakdown: Stay Long 🚀,MarketsSwing,1601269813,"Despite this month's selloff I am very bullish on the S&amp;P500 in the near future especially if we get a positive news catalyst (stimulus/vaccine news). 

Positions: $SPY 9/28 $330C and 9/30 $332C (I plan to be load up on more calls this week to buy myself additional time).

https://preview.redd.it/74eiko8gltp51.png?width=3031&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=273af15317e08c0b14e622bd36814426cf1e1acc

**Heres a quick breakdown of the chart I posted above:** Notice how price action is respecting the black channel structure. Additionally you can see a clear bullish engulfing candle on the 4H chart supported by large buying volume. Notice the volume profile as well (the blue/yellow bars and the red line). The volume profile illustrates the volume at each level in the range, but more importantly the red line (POC) illustrates the level with the most buy/sell volume in the range.

Now let's look at the higher timeframe to see why this \~$3200 level is so significant:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g1czbvbjltp51.png?width=3912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58a303ce4b42865c99b669c6a9cddac6c54d970a

The $3200 has been a key level of market structure since the beginning of the year. Back in late January this level acted as support and price failed to break below it twice. In June this level acted as resistance and we saw a &gt;9% selloff. Now price is bouncing once again from that key support level as well as the 100 SMA (light blue line on the chart)

All of these technicals suggest a move up. I like to keep my targets reasonable and reassess as price moves but my current target levels are \~$3300, $3325, and $3355 on the SPX500 CFD chart (a few points lower if you are looking at the ES chart). I also have a super extended target of $3500 which is unlikely but still completely possible.

&amp;#x200B;

We can definitely see a pullback first (illustrated above) to shakeout some bulls. this could happen overnight during the London/pre-market trading session to shaft weekend call holders like myself, but I'll take any pullback as an opportunity to add longs.

I am a programmer working for one of the larger Shopify app developer companies. I believe I can provide some interesting insights into information that others would not necessarily be aware of.

Based on the success of my company’s Shopify app and from what I’ve gathered from other Shopify app developers, Shopify is going to have a **very good quarter**, and Shopify continues today to be a huge market leader in terms of features, app integrations, etc... (and fuck that sad turd Big Commerce, they are so far behind Shopify it is a joke that they went public this early).

**Some insights:**

1. There are many *majorly* popular apps out there (more popular than ours). Based on what I know they are likely bringing in $1M+ per month. There are at least \~50 of these super-popular apps, and *hundreds* of slightly less-popular apps making $100k+ per month. Shopify gets 20% of those profits with absolutely no overhead on them (pure taxed profits).
2. Lots of apps have “Enterprise” pricing for Plus stores. So a basic Shopify store may pay $10/mo for an app, but then a big Plus store will end up paying $600 per month. This is common for the popular, high-end apps.
3. Shopify Plus store plans start at $2k per month and can go up from there. For large stores that want to host multilingual sites and have separate sites for different markets, e.g. US and Japan, they pay for multiple sites. It is common to see a single customer paying $20k per month for 10 sites. This is typical, and is basically required for large customers that cater to multiple regions.
4. Shopify hosts some very large stores (It is not simply a platform for mom &amp; pop shops). Since apps have access to store information I can tell you that there are a lot of famous brand-names making $100M+ per year on Shopify and more.
5. Our customer base has been growing like crazy, and there’s a fairly even mix between small stores and big stores. Shopify caters to stores of all sizes and overall seems to be gaining in popularity more and more each passing month.
6. There seems to have been a major inflow in the past 6 months, no doubt due largely to COVID, as people who had previously only thought about building an online store, finally decided to do it.
7. Literally ANYONE can create a Shopify store and begin selling drop shipped items. It might sound gay, but they make money at it and Shopify makes money on it too. With Shopify built-in marketing tools, and app connections, it stupid simple to market your products and the prices of dropshipped stuff is absolutely nuts. Sunglasses, makeup, phone cases, computers.... All of it is typically 70% to 90% margin.

I am happy to answer any questions. I only have insights from an “app developer” perspective though, I do not work for, nor am I associated with Shopify in any way.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j1569l/shopify_dd_for_earnings_1027/
76,The winner of the COVID-19 Vaccine race,JessicaStyne180,1601265609,"The front contendors for the coronavirus/covid19 vaccine are Pfizer, Astrazeneca, and Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Moderna. Pfizer is set to release it's results from it's late stage trial on October 27th, while Moderna is set to release it's results in November or December at the latest. Johnson and Johnson is set for early 2021, and Astrazeneca's trail is currently still on hold in the USA due to severe neurological complications a participant developed.

That leaves Pfizer and Moderna as the two top contestants to release a coroanvirus vaccine sometimes this year, with Pfizer being approximately 1 month ahead of Moderna. 

Risk Management:

As for risk management, if these companies fail to create a vaccine for whatever reason, then I believe the ones most affected will be  Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Moderna has 0 products on the market, which makes it an outlier compared to the other three companies which have an array of successful products that generate revenue. Johnson &amp; Johnson has had past controversies with it's popular baby powder causing cancer. However, I don't believe Johnson &amp; Johnson will be affected much if at all due to a failed vaccine.

Based on the timeline presented by these companies for their vaccine and the risks to these companies if the vaccine fails, I believe **Pfizer will be the winner of the Coronavirus vaccine race**. It has a slew of other products should it's vaccine fail, and it has progressed the fastest out of all the other contenders.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j155qt/the_winner_of_the_covid19_vaccine_race/

As the day went by I would look at them slowly go down back for a loss. And I didn’t feel anything, it felt like a game. I just shrugged it off. I then woke up.

1,it's time think BEYOND TSLA,Cold-Cash-1842,1601260139,"YOLOing on weeklies is great. Its the adrenaline rush that can only be compared to seeing your dad's wife's boyfriend's dick for the second time - HOWEVER why layer on more risk to the already ridiculous odds of hitting it big on weeklies. You know deep down TSLA is played out - it's the bitcorn of stocks - tons of people piling into something that is essentially worthless, hoping this time, another large group of people will follow behind them and they won't be the last ones out. You know ""papa El0n' is the pump master, you know his company makes less profit than a barnes and noble that sells spaghetti, you know deep down that $156-$2000 was some shit you wish you'd got into... but you didn't. So leave it alone. Don't add chaos to the ultra high stakes game of naked, fast decay calls. I'm not saying this because ""you'll lose money"" Im actually saying this because there's so much more money to be made out there.

I propose combining the aggressive, retarded nature of weeklies with the more calm and predictable nature of ETFs. Specifically QQQ. Buy more contracts, double down more, shit, go hard and keep that shit gangster but don't pour into the weak ass skate spot that got popular with rollerbladers.

25,Am I Insane? I'm going to buy lots of puts on SPXS.,FinallySomeMurrder,1601255509,"[Leveraged ETFs](https://youtu.be/l6v3EfNVI8c?t=60) are definitely not for passive investors as obviously they are extremely volatile. Due to high operational costs and time decay, a leveraged ETF will slowly lose value if whatever index it tracks trades sideways. Since most leveraged ETFs have to be reset at the end of each trading day in order to mimic the next day's return, there's the prospect of a error developing where the ETF doesn't reflect the index over a long period of time. Many investors say to do nothing except daytrade these stocks as they invariably perform poorly.

But that is not always the case with strong growing indexes. [SPXL](https://www.bing.com/search?q=spxl&amp;cvid=25a3a88c2c16438a9c421e27c72b157f&amp;FORM=ANAB01&amp;PC=DCTS) is a 3X leveraged ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500, and it has consistently shown real growth three times greater than [SPY](https://www.bing.com/search?q=spy+stock&amp;qs=LS&amp;pq=spy+&amp;sc=6-4&amp;cvid=13352D7A8DD040319037C11C771B15FA&amp;FORM=QBRE&amp;sp=1&amp;ghc=1) which is a regular index of the S&amp;P 500. Which is why lunatics like me will sell covered calls and trade options with these stocks regardless what some people say.

But I have a thought, what if we could have both leverage and time decay work for us? [SPXS](https://www.bing.com/search?q=spxs&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=spxs&amp;sc=7-4&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=E6AC3BB7843348778A40A532A40BD2B4) is a INVERSE 3X leveraged ETF tracking the S&amp;P 500. Meaning if SPY loses 5%, SPXS gains 15%. Time decay, the index tracked, operational costs, and simple leverage all say this stock won't just lose, but it will pound the ground consistently. So... PUTS!

Specifically; inverse rolling LEAP options. Buy puts expiring in 2-3 years can be held for 6-12 months before selling it and buying a new put with a later expiration date. The extra time added is to hedge against the risk of short term downturns. Backtracking shows even during 2008-2009 recession this method could have worked or at least breakeven, assuming you didn't get paperhands. Oh yes, in spite the Covid lockdown, SPXS is at half the value it was in February this year.

27,NIO looks consolidated and ready for another big run up into October-November,zg44,1601254430,"Disclaimers: This is a high risk play.  Do your own research.  I got a 14+ bagger off NIO in late August on the same consolidated setup when NIO got several analyst upgrades and leapt 50% before the September deliveries were announced.  There is no guarantee that this same pattern repeats itself even though the price/volume/trend setup is nearly identical.

&amp;#x200B;

This NIO trade is a pure momentum trade, since it appears fully consolidated by price/volume in terms of how its trading range has narrowed, which means that it's prepared for another breakout if good news comes.

The known potential catalysts are the September deliveries which will either be announced on Friday October 2 or Monday-Tuesday October 5-6, and then later on will be the October deliveries/early November earnings date.

The unknown potential catalyst would come from analyst upgrades/downgrades.  These are probably the biggest driver but impossible to predict.

&amp;#x200B;

Why I believe a breakout can happen:  I'm bullish on September deliveries because they announced BaaS (Battery as a Service) in late August which should lower initial prices paid and make their cars appear significantly cheaper for up-front buyers, which should increase sales.  Second, they just started delivery this past week of the cheaper EC6 model (but that will have more of an impact on October).  Note that September only has 30 days, so that means 1 day less of sales.  They've also recently improved capacity of output to 5000 cars per month.

This is also the consumption season in China after some tough months of flooding/exceptional rainfall, so perhaps that seasonality could provide a larger than expected boost to sales figures.

My expectation is that they announce 4200+ sales for September and then 4700+ in October.

&amp;#x200B;

Why the price might breakdowninstead: This is trading way above fundamental values: a 5k monthly car maker trading for $25 billion market cap is laughable (let alone going up another 20+%), we all know the real value here is probably around $5 per share. 

Eventually fundamentals will reassert themselves, but given how overpriced/overbought EV stocks are, I don't think that will happen yet, which is why I think the bias is towards another breakout if analysts upgrade the stock after September or October deliveries.

  
How to play this: I've been buying a lot of November 20 calls (30/35 strikes) as well as October 16 calls (strikes in the 20-25 range).

Note: I'm just using a portion of my profit from my prior NIO play so I'm playing with house money.  Determine your own risk tolerance.

  
When to exit: I like to take a % off the table at different values (200% gain/400% gain/etc.); if the stock jumps a lot before Friday on sales anticipation, take some off the table because the sales number could be a ""sell the news"" event unless the number is way above 4000.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the squiggly lines (yes I know TA is basically just nonsense that confirm prior biases but price/volume action have some predictive value).  There's obviously a chance that the stock just moves sideways and nothing happens or the stock breaks down and the call options bleed to zero.

4,NKLA pivots to Oil Drilling after Trevor dug the backyard in his new crib,antique_legal,1601236496,"Monday 4:20AM - In a surprise announcement from a new twitter handle, Tons_of_Milfton,  genius billionaire playboy and Wsb short seller philanthropist Trevor Milton announced that NKLA shall now enter the oil exploration space after discovering oil in his backyard. 

The discovery was apparently made when Trevor tried to bury one of the illegal immigrants who fell off his roof while installing solar panels in order to meet quarterly targets. 

""We see it as a natural progression from making EVs, to hydrogen vehicles, to partnering with GM, to buying our truck designs, to installing solar panels on the rooftop of my humble home. Oil was the only missing aspect in our portfolio which is already more diverse than my personal dildo collection."" 

""Speaking of dildos, we shall be introducing a full range of a new product line made from crude oil:
 Lube. We strongly believe that the upcoming Nikola World event is likely to rip our investors a new asshole, and it it our highest privilege to assist them in every way"" said Trevor, with his usual calm demeanor and fake glasses. 

When asked about his next moves, he looked into our reporters eyes and calmly said, ""Milfs."" 

Reports from highly placed sources also tell us that he has filed for officially changing his surname to Milfton in order to demonstrate his commitment to this venture, just like his previous endeavours. ""I am of the opinion that this pandemic brings a new opportunity for NKLA to make tendies in a previously under (booty) tapped market, and milfs shall be even better than TSLA's self driving technology as the value proposition simply makes more sense. People love Milfs, and we shall create a fleet of milfs who shall drive our milk trucks, codenamed MilfTrucks."" 

GM has extended positive support to this initiative and a new deal is expected to be reported soon. A milk supplier shall be identified, and first orders have already been received from... Trevor.

Jim Cramer compared this to Apple's pivot after Steve Jobs came back for the second time, and upgraded the stock to a strong buy. ""After having received a barrel, I am convinced that this company shall exceed expectations, and it could possibly receive many orders from Boeing, or even better, Stark Industries."" Jim later clarified that he was definitely not sure whether the white packet that accompanied the barrel was milk powder or cocaine.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j0xnvv/nkla_pivots_to_oil_drilling_after_trevor_dug_the/

6,The non-DD DD: recent catalysts surely indicate we're moving to the right,WhiteHattedRaven,1601236103,"Alright folks -- let's get a bit more involved than yelling (catchphrase)† at each other, and try to add some reasoning in. Dumb and useless since the market has no logic, I know, but I need something better than staring at weekend dow and jerking off. I want to discuss some different timeframes - the daily thread typically has people arguing with each other when one is holding leaps and the other is holding weeklies. They might both be right, so let's be specific.

Here's a list of questions to get us started, and I'll add my own thoughts on all of these. Voice your opinion, but please also include the _why_. That way we can think through it together. Mainly interested in SPY/IWM, but all thoughts welcome. Stuff like ""cruise lines stock"" probably deserves a separate look.

* Has the month of September been the start of a larger downtrend? If yes, how long do you expect this to continue?
* Are we seeing a reversal of the downtrend/correction with Friday's move? If yes, is it short term for mostly next 1-2 weeks, or are you bullish through the new year?

Timeframes we're interested in are:

* Next week.
* Next ~40 days heading into the election, and the ~2 weeks following it.
* Jan 2021 and further.

Recent catalyst topics:

* Vaccine news (J&amp;J Phase 3).
* Stimmy round 2 news (bill passing/almost ready in House).
* Florida &amp; others reopening fully.
* Europe lockdowns 2: wave 2 boogaloo.
* Azerbaijan/Armenia conflict.

Longer-term bullish reasons:

* Stonks only go up (inflation, low-interest-rates driving money to equities).
* Sector-based 'rona advantages, like QQQ and SPY.
* Money on the sidelines since March.
* Further DXY drops fueling equity ""growth"".

Longer-term bearish reasons:

* Corona never went anywhere and all signs point us to being headed into tougher months.
* Extremely overvalued valuations (e.g. P/E ratios).
* Civil unrest (mainly U.S., but also Belarus and others).

Positions:

* 401k - Bonds (account doesn't have cash option), re-balanced in Feb. Should have re-balanced back into stocks; expensive lesson. But I am patient and I see further downside. 🌈🐻
* Roth - Various SPAC commons/warrants; I think these catch you a ban though, so shhh.
* Robinhood - Blown up (on MGM, PCG, etc.); fuck their fills too, try something like ETrade/Fidelity and feel the difference instantly.
* Others - VXX Dec 18 calls ($27, $30), SPXW puts (Oct 16/30, $3350, $3240, $3270), CMG Oct 16 puts ($1215, $1190), JNJ Jan 15 '21 $145 calls, PRPL shares and calls (didn't buy at the peak, so... have their mattress, am bullish), various other SPAC warrants and calls.

28,Mining to the moon,MaxKevinComedy,1601230756,"I've been sucking Peter Schiff's golden dick for 12+ years now after getting anally raped last week I've come to the conclusion that too few people understand the reason for, and make up RETARDED arguments as to why gold and silver are bad plays. Let's go over some of those fucking dumb arguments now:


pEoPle OnLy Like GolD CuZ iT's sHiNy: No you dumb fuck. Fundamentally, everything can be used as money, cigarettes, oil, bottled diarrhea dumps. Gold and silver became money because of their chemical properties, which they share with only 3 other elements, platinum, palladium, and rhodium, perhaps you've heard of them?! If it wasn't for the tax code, we would ALREADY be on a  pent-metal standard because that would be what the market chose to use as money, because these metals naturally have all the best properties for money, in addition to their use in industry. Meanwhile we have dumb fucks tying up 200B+ of market cap buying LITERAL NOTHING (things that end in -coin) because they don't understand what money is. 


TheRe's dEflaTIon: No you dumb fuck. Look at the GD money supply chart. Inflation is an increase in the money supply. Fundamentally, economic growth creates deflation, because growth means that you are creating more resources than you consumed. If the money supply stays the same and resources increase, the money is worth more. This year the world shut down production for 6 months while increasing the size of the money supply like your wife increases the size of the dick that's fucking her while you watch in the corner. OH YEAH printing 5 trillion dollars while halving production will give us deflation, shut up you central planning propaganda regurgitating cuck.


DXY iS uP: Who gives a fuck if foreign printers are brrrrrring more than American ones? And they aren't, they just don't have the luxury of being able to export their inflation due to the reserve currency status of the dollar. An increase in the price of the dollar compared to other currencies doesn't make it strong relative to assets. Jesus Tendie Christ how dumb do you have to be to miss the forest from the trees like this. If foreign currencies are inflating more than the dollar, causing DXY to rise, then it is bearish for metals? How fucking dumb are you? 

PresCIoUS MetaLs are ManiPulAtEd: This one actually is true. But the firms can only manipulate so much, if everyone just took a look at Peter Schiff's massive shiny bulge as much as I have, and enough people believed in gold and silver, the market caps would be much higher, and much more difficult to manipulate. So much of investing is just psychology, and right now not enough people believe in metals, which is why I need each of you to go door to door, wear a nice tie, and tell your neighbors about our lord and savior Ron Paul. 


Why to buy mining stocks:


I'm guessing most of you were still sucking on mommy's teet back in 2008 when the whole world went to shit. Not me, I was a full grown adult with big dick energy. The problem was, a housing bubble made the prices of houses triple in a five year period, and now all these Gen X people bought houses they could never afford, and rather than let housing prices fall back to normal levels, the ""mainstream economists"" decided it would be a good idea to buy all the shit no one wanted to keep the prices inflated. FUCKING BRILLIANT MAN. So the Fed opened up their balance sheet like your GF spreads her cheeks, bought all the shit no one wanted, and started this thing called QE. At first people were unsure that it would work, which caused gold, silver, and all commodities to moon for the next 3 years. But then around 2012-2013 everyone became convinced that it would actually work! Hey guys, remember Enron, they did the exact same thing, just put the shit on a different balance sheet, and it totally worked too, it's accounting magic! 


So what happened next, is dumb dumbs sold off commodities for the next five years, until around 2018 when the Fed decided hey, we should try to raise interest rates and unload some of this shit on our balance sheet. Since then gold has been BULKING, why you ask? Because QE was a giant failure, turns out you can't just use accounting gimmicks to make it seem like reality is different. The truth is, the Fed can NEVER raise rates, they can NEVER unload their balance sheet. Their two options are keep rates low and get a shit ton of inflation like the 1970s (ask your grandma), or allow rates to rise and have interest payments on the debt consume the entire federal budget. They're stuck between a rock and a giant dildo up the ass hard place.


Gold and silver never should have fallen from their 2011 highs, the only reason they fell was because the world believed QE worked, but it should be CLEARLY FUCKING OBVIOUS that QE was a giant failure, gold should be 4000 and silver should be 80 RIGHT FUCKING NOW if enough people realized this god damn obvious fact. Jesus Christ it's like the whole world is a cuck watching his GF getting plowed on the bed in front of him but still claims she's a virgin.   


But even if gold and silver don't go up, even if gold stays around the 1900 level for the next year, the miners are priced 50% lower than they have been with similar gold prices. WTF other buying signal do you need? These companies have great fundamentals, had little to no problems from COVID, and are structured to operate with a $1250 price of gold. They all report their earnings in November and this is going to be the first quarter of earnings with high gold prices, so quite literally, they are all going to SMESH - Khabib Nurmagomedov.

Alternatively I brought a Quarterly call for September.

When Thursday comes and I end up being right and it jumps to $25 which of the two makes me more money:

a. the weekly option I brought on the monday ending this week on Friday?

b.the monthly option I brought on monday?

I would assume the weekly would be less because of Theta but this subreddit seems to always say you make more on weeklies regardless as long as it's before day of expire, which Thursday would be.

69,Take advantage of the EV goldrush by completing the EV Trifecta,jalapenojacker,1601218722,"As you may already know, we are currently in the midst of an EV goldrush. Early adopters, investors, and gamblers will be rewarded for identifying these opportunities and capitalizing on them. 

One way to ensure that you gain enough exposure to capitalize on this this gold rush is by completing the EV Trifecta, which are:

1. EV Manufacturers 
2. Raw materials for batteries
3. EV charging stations

I will go into a bit more detail on each component of the trifecta:

 

1. EV Manufacturers - These are companies that develop and manufacturer EV for the public to newly purchase. There is a lot of EV manufacturers that are going public, some of them will be achieve market dominance, while others will dwindle away \*cough\* NKL(A). These are some of the EV manufacturers that are available for the public to invest in: TSLA, NI(O), XPE(V), KND(I), L(I), SHL(L), PI(C), HCA(C), SPA(Q). Currently, TSLA is the market leader in this industry and also have the first mover advantage, and this is clearly reflected in their stock price. All the other EV manufacturers are up and coming and will have lots of run room as EVs become more prevalent in our day to day lives.

2. Raw materials for batteries - The logic here is that as demand for EV increase, so will the demand for the raw materials used to create the batteries for the EVs. Simple economics 101 states that as demand increase and supply decreases, price should increase accordingly. These are the current raw materials companies that have a spotlight on them: LA(C), VAL(E), PL(L). PL(L) is the only raw materials company that have a public contract with TSL(A) and has been halted for weeks because of this news. PL(L) will definitely be a hot buy once it unhalts. 

3. EV charging stations - In order for EVs to be come more prominent in our day to day lives, there needs to be a proper infrastructure that will enable that. One of the biggest concerns in regards to EV is range anxiety - drivers don't want to be left stranded if they forget to charge their vehicles overnight at home. Having charging stations that are widely available will help combat this risk. The EV charging station market is relatively untapped, and this market will grow along side the EV market. The key players in the EV Charging station are SB(E), BLN(K), SP(I). SP(I) had an insane run up last week when they announced their EV initiative, their share price increased over 3000% from $1.50 to over $40 (this was short lived though). BLN(K) is a mixed bag, there are some complaints in regards to the quality of their charging stations, but hopefully they'll improve over time. SB(E) is a SP@(C) merger to bring Chargepoint public. Similar to TSL(A), Chargepoint is the market leader in the charging station space and also have the first mover advantage. Chargepoint currently has hundred of thousands of charging stations across North America (US and Canada) and is expanding into Europe. Their products can be purchased via their home website or Amazon and have great reviews online.

Also, they focus more on luxury rather than speed. These two factors are why I see it taking off there. Oh, and ads in Beijing certainly help, and it shows that either NIO has the money for ads in Beijing, or they think their sales will be able to make up for the money they are spending on them. This is really good.

""We received the Governor’s executive order and are evaluating it to determine what it may mean for our business. We are not making any immediate changes. As a reminder, face coverings are still required at Walt Disney World Resort.”

Right now Disney is operating parks with reduced capacity and ticket holders need to reserve dates to attend.  Consequently a lot of the bars and restaurants and the park and resorts have remained closed.  This includes Disney springs which is entirely bars and restaurants mixed in with various retail spaces and they limit capacity to parking at 1 of the 3 garages they have in the area. 

Think it’s good news for Disney and I’ll take it a step further and gamble to say that the republicans win in November and Disney is at normal capacity by the first of the year.

2,Crude Oil Analysis with the Market Profile,UC_Trading,1601198068,"The following market analysis of the Crude Oil (CL) futures market is based on the recent price developments and concludes with a potential future price movement. The analysis has been implemented with Sierra Chart tools utilising the weekly market profile in combination with the volume profile. Fundament of the analysis is the related order flow course and respective workbook principles   

**Analysis**

The week before last week, the crude oil market performed a strong long push (1) and created significant volume in the upper area resulting in a range (2). Last week, sellers illustrated strength and leading to a breakout to the downside of the range (3).

[Weekly Market Profile \(CL\)](https://preview.redd.it/fl59ols6qnp51.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ff76861e717f5575118c0ac6e509b447341f409)

Subsequently, the market consolidated the entire week and created a large range. The market’s context can be defined neutral as long as the price remains in that range.

[M15 Candle Stick Chart \(CL\)](https://preview.redd.it/0dnjimbaqnp51.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=177d83ba7879d633b4b9043113ad0dd0d5a94e23)

Considering a long perspective, the market needs to break the upper range level (4) with a first target at the earlier upper range (2) level. In contrast on the short side, the market needs to break the lower range level (5) with a first potential target at the weekly VPOC level.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j0o57e/crude_oil_analysis_with_the_market_profile/

Here's how we profit, and no it's not buying puts. We open up a credit spread. Let's be honest here, this shit isn't gonna go above $20 so we open a spread that guarantees profit if it closes below $20 by expiry. And yes you will have to put up collateral to open this spread but you're way more likely to profit than if you just buy a put and this way you get the credit up front. Even if trading is halted you still keep the tendies.

Does not compute:  
What if A never reaches $17? If I sell my call when A is $16, will I have lost $100? What happens on 10/16 if A never reaches $15? Also why would I even have the option (on Robinhood) to buy calls with strike prices lower than the current value? And what the fuck is time value?

FT: Nikola founder bought truck designs from third party


* * *
https://www.ft.com/content/9bd5e3f3-4d09-458c-b390-bc94b1f4a024

The original design for Nikola’s flagship truck was purchased by founder Trevor Milton from a designer in Croatia, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, despite company claims in a 2018 lawsuit that the vehicle was initially designed by Mr Milton “in his basement”.

The truck, the Nikola One, is at the centre of a $2bn lawsuit with Tesla, in which Nikola alleges its rival infringed on its patents. Nikola claims in that lawsuit that Mr Milton began designing the model in 2013, with other company staff later working on it.

In a rebuttal to the lawsuit filed last week, Tesla alleged that Nikola could not protect the designs because they did not originate from the company itself, but from Adriano Mudri, a designer based in Croatia.

Two people with knowledge of the transaction told the Financial Times that the Nikola founder bought the designs in 2015 after meeting Mr Mudri while visiting electric supercar maker Rimac in Croatia.

While Tesla’s filing identifies the designer as the source of the original truck drawings, it does not contain details about the transaction, explain that money was exchanged, or that Mr Milton himself orchestrated the purchase.

The latest twist comes with Nikola still reeling from accusations earlier this month that it passed off purchased technology as its own, covering supplier names on key components with stickers when making promotional videos. Nikola said it never claimed it made the components.

In a report that sent Nikola’s shares tanking, Mr Milton was accused of spreading an “ocean of lies” about the company’s technology and its products by short seller Hindenburg Research.

A little over a week later, Mr Milton decided to leave the company, telling staff he planned to defend himself “against false allegations levelled against me by outside detractors”. The 39-year old founder has repeatedly insisted that he has not lied to or deceived anyone about the trucks.

The lawsuit with Tesla, filed during Mr Milton’s tenure, centres on the origins of the designs for the “Nikola One” truck.

The company claims that Mr Milton worked for two years on the truck before, unsatisfied with his designs, he hired designer Steve Jennes in 2015. The lawsuit says the pair then crafted the final design between them in a lengthy process.

When it was finished, Nikola had spent “several million dollars developing the Nikola One”, according to the lawsuit.

In its rebuttal, Tesla said that the designs for the model originated from Mr Mudri, a designer at Rimac, who had dubbed it the “Road Runner”. The design’s origins could raise further questions about Nikola’s intellectual property.

“Trevor Milton chose not to disclose the Road Runner concept truck to the [US Patent and Trademark Office] with deceptive intent,” Tesla said in its filing.

Nikola said: “The Nikola One truck was designed and patented by Nikola. It is commonplace to license third party designs during vehicle development, and although early in the process Nikola purchased a license to Antonio Mudri’s designs, he was not part of the design team and his designs are materially different from the design invented by Nikola for the Nikola One.”

According to several people with knowledge of the deal, Mr Milton sought, unsuccessfully, to collaborate with Rimac on a range of projects in 2015.

On a trip to Rimac’s headquarters on the outskirts of Zagreb, he met Mr Mudri, the company’s designer, who had designed a futuristic truck as part of an earlier diploma project.

Mr Milton purchased the computer drawings and virtual 3D model of the vehicle for several thousand dollars from Mr Mudri, according to two people.

The Road Runner name lingered for months. A person familiar with the development of the Nikola One said that “Road Runner . . . was the internal name for Nikola’s project the entire time we worked on it”.

A screenshot of a Nikola document seen by the Financial Times, shows 13 people being invited to collaborate on the “Nikola Roadrunner Prototype Project”.

Another screenshot shows an early version of Nikola’s website depicting a truck that appears identical to the Road Runner in Tesla’s court filing.

Nikola did not mention Mr Mudri, or Rimac, or say that the designs were purchased, in its 2018 filing against Tesla.

Representatives for Mr Milton declined to comment. Rimac also declined to comment.

7,Selling calls for more than the capital put into a stock using margin?,bkorsedal,1601156291,"So.... I have a dumb idea. I have an account that is separate from my other accounts and I can get good interest rates on margin debt. I am thinking about buying some First Majestic Silver stock and selling Jan 2023 calls. Some of the calls can be sold above my cost basis to buy the stock, so I'm actually getting cash out of the process.

First Majestic is at $9.52 right now. I think my margin to buy I have to cover 66%, or 65%? It recently changed. So I can buy it for $6.18. I can turn around and sell an $5 Jan 2023 call for maybe $7. That locks in a 26% profit over two years and I get more cash out than I put in, so I could theoretically do a feedback loop. I could also sell $8 Jan 2023 calls for about $5.50. That would get me a 40% profit over two years.

I also might wait for a bit, I feel there might be a big drop in the stock market and a corresponding spike in the VIX which would really increase my profitability. As long as I avoid a margin call, then it's basically free money? Right?

The stock would have to drop down to $4.76 for me to get a margin call? I might wait to see if there is a big drop then execute. I'm just strategizing right now.  I would do this in a separate account with nothing else in there.  I would prefer to not loose everything in that account, but if the risk to reward is good, I might go for it.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j0efci/selling_calls_for_more_than_the_capital_put_into/

It's an Over-The-Counter stock based in Australia selling at about 4 cents a share. There are fees associated with buying these kind of stocks, and you can't buy them with Robinhood.

Ok, now that's it's just the two of us left here, let's say you use TD Ameritrade. They impose a $6.95 fee per transaction on OTC stocks AND an additional $15 foreign transaction fee if you are American. So that's $21.95 in fees. Because of this you wouldn't want to buy small amounts because you would be paying such a high premium. 

Let's say we're ok paying a 5% premium via fees. 21.95 / .05 = $439

So if our total investment was $439 (including fee), the fee would basically add a 5% premium to the stock price.

$439 - $21.95 in fees = $417.05 that goes towards stock. Divide that by a share price of 4 cents and you get 10,426.25 shares. Let's round up to 10,500 shares and multiply by the share price of 4 cents and you get a price of $420, before fees. This is clearly a sign of how mathematics is woven into our reality in ways we cannot fathom and, in this case, is giving us a buy signal.

&amp;#x200B;

39,Reg SHO list update,Pyr0smurf,1601149870,"After a few days of research I’ve come up with more information on the workings of this. If any information is in accurate or misunderstood on my part feel free to to correct me; I am by no means an expert. 

As I have come to understand, a security will make the list after failing to deliver shares for a position. Time starts ticking day one, and at day T+3 it makes the list if the dollar value of the position meets the threshold established by the SEC. This is most often associated with opening short positions, as the shares for the short position must be borrowed to be sold. 

HOWEVER from what I’ve managed to gather; the position is allowed to be opened and it becomes the brokers responsibility to then find shares to borrow after the fact. They do not need to be available at the time of the order being opened. This is where a stock making the list comes into play. After 13 days however, any positions opened that still have not had shares located to fulfill the brokers obligation MUST be closed, and the must be bought from from the open market. 

Now as I originally started my research into this to make my decision for GME, I will use that as an example. They made the list the 22nd. That would make the original date of failure to deliver the 16th. So if my understanding is correct, and it may not be 100%, the 29th would start the forced closing of all positions which have not had sufficient amounts of shares located for borrow. 

Aside from my original purpose of researching this, it seems this list would be a powerful tool to find possible squeeze candidates. Critique and further in depth explanation welcome.

40,Option Strategy - help,jdawg_stonks_420,1601149868,"Let's get something out of the way immediately:

*I blew up my account during the whole battery day bullshit.* 

Ok now for the heart of the post:

I want to get back into options after the election. I see post every so often that say something along the lines of ""Took my account from $300 -&gt; $30k in 3 months"". Then they list out like 15 trades that they did. Do you guys have criteria for these trades? Do you use some type of option scanner? I know you just don't pull them out of your ass.

 If anyone could point me in the right direction on how to build  up a trade strategy, I would greatly appreciate it. I want to strategically build up my account. Last time I had this ""always have to be in a trade"" feeling, this ultimately led to me blowing my shit up - making hasty decisions just to be IN a trade, i'm fucking stupid. I'm thinking I want to get back in with $1k. How much do I risk on each trade? 10%? 

Oh yeah, also want to know about the types of timeframes you guys find most successful. I want a happy medium between full on leaps and weeklies. I know weeklies are stupid and risky. I know leaps are slow an steady - but also expensive and can blow up in your face too. Is there something in the middle? 

Anyway.

TLDR: Trying to understand what tools you guys use to pick your trades you want to get into. I have a feeling it's an option scanner, would like to know what you use and what filters you have. I know you don't pull it out of your ass. Also timeframes.

82,Possible NVIDIA 3000 card callbacks,JohnnysDrama,1601139808," **NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**  


Listen up idiots, 

So most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual ""brain"" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.  

But that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.

&amp;#x200B;

[Big Capacitors](https://preview.redd.it/63d87b2bwip51.png?width=980&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a95dc6f5ecad00af735592a86b9d9f64a919c504)

&amp;#x200B;

[Big + Small \(more expensive but better\)](https://preview.redd.it/jnv10ezcwip51.png?width=980&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f67fb502c4876ff55bc3ea7b1abe92b957c1d74)

 By cheaping out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to down clock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.    


EVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.  


Positions:  
None currently because I don't think the suits could give two shits.

12,DD - GM has a lot of negative potential,Vainglory27,1601132354,"Hey Autists

I did some research and I conclude that GM has alot of reasons to drop in the next two weeks and personally alot of down side risks over the next 5 years do to Covid.



1) Nikola is a dumpster fire and the bad PR of either GM backing out of the deal or more negative PR will make GM look worse.



2) California gas car ban affects GM directly in their valuation. 40 times P/E it's only 15 years til 2035 of no more sales in Cali. Which is like 4% of GM sales



3) The Bolt has bad reviews and costs way too much. Model 3 is same price and better cause of supercharger network.



4) Nikola deal was 2 bil in Stock but now it's only worth 1 bil over 5 years with some covenants. 200 mil / years isn't worth the PR risk and engineering work. Associating yourself with Nikola now makes your EV team look like your way behind.



5) Covid hurts GM and will probably make them suck for the next 3 years. Rental cars aren't upgrading their fleets. Dividend was slashed March last earning a was -700mil



6) GM sucks at EVs their sustainability report was terrible. They do not have the ability to make an economic cheap EV and are years behind.



Hold timeframe



1) I short stock so I'm prepped to hold for 3 years barring a trigger event or a gain of +7% below $27



2) could be next week when GM pulls out of Nikola deal

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 28th, 2020.

# **Market volatility expected to continue in the week ahead with Presidential debate and jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/market-volatility-expected-to-continue-in-the-week-ahead-with-presidential-debate-and-jobs-report.html)**
*****
&gt; Stock market volatility, with sharp ups, downs and reversals, is likely to be the norm again in the week ahead, as investors await Friday’s jobs report and watch headlines from Washington and the presidential debate.
*****
&gt; Expectations remain low for a stimulus package from Congress, but as economists downgrade their view of fourth quarter growth because of a lack of further federal virus aid, investors are again looking for some guidance from Washington. The election is likely to be a market focus in the week ahead, as the first presidential debate takes place between President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden Tuesday night.
*****
&gt; Stocks were very volatile in the past week, but the S&amp;P 500 was down less than 1% for the week by Friday afternoon. For the month of September, it is down about 6%.
*****
&gt; “We’re really seeing now a typical September, but under the hood we’re seeing what is potentially a rotation from the large tech stocks to a broader pool of stocks,” said Don Townswick, director of equities strategy for Conning. He expects tech to remain a favorite after the shakeout, and the market tone could change in October if earnings results are good and company outlooks are positive.
*****
&gt; “I think that tends to turn things around,” he said.
*****
&gt; Economists expect the much anticipated September employment report, the last before the election, to show a slower pace of job growth than in August. The consensus forecast is for 920,000 nonfarm payrolls, from 1.37 million in August, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to drop to 8.2% from 8.4%. JP Morgan economists said they expect job growth to continue, but they also said the lack of stimulus and aid to the unemployed could slow consumer spending. They reduced their forecast for fourth quarter GDP growth to 2.5% from 3.5% Thursday.
*****
&gt; # Election watch
Michael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said the debate may have more potential to move the market than the jobs report. “Most people talk about these things and get all fired up and nothing happens, but this is such a weird year... This seems like the first big shot to see these guy in action. We think it’s a big event,” he said.
*****
&gt; Schumacher said if Trump is perceived to win, and his chances rise in prediction markets by several points, there could be a positive move in risk markets and the bond market could sell off, sending yields higher. Trump is perceived as better for stocks and the economy, and Biden is expected to push for higher taxes and more regulation, he said.
*****
&gt; “We think that pushes the 10-year yield up to 75 or 80 basis points,” he said. The 10-year has been locked in a range below 0.70% and was at 0.65% Friday.
*****
&gt; “If Biden wins, then the debate is risk off. Then Trump’s chances of winning probably go to 40%, maybe lower. Then the 10-year yield goes to 0.60%,” he said.
*****
&gt; The market was also expected to be volatile in the coming week because of month-end and quarter-end rebalancing, but Schumacher said the stock market sell-off has taken some of the pressure off of the need to realign portfolios and he expects about $9 billion to move into bonds for rebalancing.
*****
&gt; Before the earnings period starts in the second week of October, the market is likely to continue to focus on what’s worrying it.
*****
&gt; “What we have... is a lot of uncertainty related to the election, a lot of uncertainty related to stimulus,” said Townswick. He does not expect the political back and forth over the appointment of a new Supreme Court justice, following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to impact the markets.
*****
&gt; “But the stimulus and election, people can say that’s going to directly relate to earnings,” he said. Townswick said the sell-off so far is not unusual for September, historically the worst month of the year.
*****
&gt; Among S&amp;P 500 companies, Townswick said 70% left their forecasts unchanged or revised them higher after second quarter earnings reports, while 30% reduced them. “If third quarter earnings come in relatively strong, then we could see more revisions upward and that would tend to support the market,” he said.
*****
&gt; Many strategists expect the S&amp;P 500 could decline all the way to its 200-day moving average which was 3,107 on Friday. The 200-day is a widely watched momentum indicator, based on the average of the closing prices in the last 200 sessions. If the index falls below it and stays there, it’s viewed as negative for the market but it often acts as support.
*****
&gt; “I don’t have a target, but I think if that does happen, I would say that is a normal pullback and I wouldn’t expect it to break through and tank. I would say that might be supportive,” Townswick said.
*****
&gt; The coming week is busy in terms of economic data. Besides the jobs report, there is ISM and PMI manufacturing data Thursday. Personal income and spending data is also released Thursday.
*****
&gt; But it is the employment data, the market is watching most closely.

&gt; Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said the weekly jobless claims data is sending a positive signal for the jobs report, but not all data matches it. The number of unemployed who have come off of state and special pandemic benefits totaled 2 million over the period between mid August and mid September, when the government collected data for Friday’s jobs report.
*****
&gt; Tilley said he will not be so much focused on the non farm payrolls as on the number of people who say their job loss is now permanent. That number rose by 534,000 last month, to a total of 3. million. It was at 1.2 million in February
*****
&gt; Initially when job losses mounted, many individuals expected their job loss was temporary.
*****
&gt; “The permanent job loss is an indication of an amount of permanent scarring that’s going on in the economy,” he said. “The permanent job loss as a share of unemployment has been more rapid than the previous recessions.”

&gt; # September Bears Strike Again

&gt; The September weakness continued with the S&amp;P 500 Index 9.6% off the all-time high set on September 2 (as of 9/23/20). It is important to remember that after a 60% rally in the S&amp;P 500—and much more in some of the large cap tech stocks—this type of seasonal weakness is normal and expected. We noted in our blog Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year that some type of seasonal weakness could be in the cards.

&gt; Speaking of seasonal weakness, the second half of September historically has been one of the worst periods of the year for stocks, as shown in our chart below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Another angle on this is showing how each day of the year does. Again, we are in the sweet spot for potential rocky seas.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “To see some late-September weakness after a record 60% rally shouldn’t be too surprising,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “What might surprise some investors, though, is that after some of the previous best six-month rallies ever, in a lot of cases, the strength continued going out a year.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the recent rally was one of the best six-month rallies ever for the S&amp;P 500. Looking at all the previous rallies that gained at least 30%, returns are somewhat muted near term. But going out a full year, prices have typically moved higher, up seven out of eight times a year later.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 October Gains Frequently Precede Presidential Incumbent Party Victories

&gt; An interesting aspect of election-year Octobers is the propensity for S&amp;P 500 gains when the incumbent party ultimately retains the White House. Of the ten incumbent victories since 1944, the S&amp;P 500 has advanced seven times, declined twice, and was unchanged in 1944 with an average October gain of 1.4%. Of the nine occurrences since 1944 when the incumbent was defeated, there were six S&amp;P 500 declines and three advances in October. The average October decline when incumbents were defeated was 2.1%. Even excluding the S&amp;P’s 16.9% plunge in 2008, incumbent defeats were still preceded by an average October loss of 0.3%.

&gt; # ""Low Energy"" Energy

&gt; US stocks are looking to close out the week on a positive note with the S&amp;P 500 up over 1%. One sector that hasn't been participating in the rally, however, is Energy. While it just moved back into positive territory for the day, the sector remains at the back of the pack in terms of sector performance. If these levels hold for the remainder of the trading day, it will be the 69th time in the last 200 trading days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector. That works out to more than once every three trading days. Talk about a sector that's in liquidation mode!

&gt; The chart below shows the rolling 200-day total number of days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500. While the current level of 69 is extremely high, earlier this month the rolling 200-day total was even higher at 71. Over this same period of time, no other sector has even seen close to as many days of ranking at the bottom as Energy. The next closest is Utilities as it has been at the bottom of the pack in terms of performance on 36 of the last 200 trading days. It hasn't just been the last 200 trading days that have been rough for the Energy sector. Over the last five years, the sector has been the worst-performing sector on just over 23% of all trading days. Is this what it felt like for the horse and buggy companies in the early 1900s or the ice-harvesting companies after the invention of electric refrigeration?

&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance

&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term “Octoberphobia” has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don’t get whipsawed if it happens.

&gt; But October has become a turnaround month—a “bear killer” if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October’s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**

&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.

&gt; # 5 Real-Time Data Charts To Track the Recovery

&gt; We check in again today on some of the real-time economic data that LPL Research is monitoring to provide timely and valuable insights into the state of the US economy. Traditional economic data is often reported too slowly to pick up the changes that are occurring in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

&gt; The latest data on US COVID-19 cases has shown steady progress since peaking at the end of July. COVID-19 hospitalizations are at the lowest levels since the end of June and are close to the lows of mid-June. The number of positive COVID cases rose over the last week, and while the number of tests performed increased, the positive test rate also increased to near 6% (source: COVID Tracking Project). Further, Labor Day get-togethers may have created the recent bump in transmission, a trend we saw following other holidays over the summer.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Even as much of the real-time data shows a slowing recovery as Americans adjust to the new normal, it’s encouraging that new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates have improved greatly since mid-summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Progress on a COVID-19 vaccine and fiscal stimulus could help the economy and markets in the fourth quarter, but as investors struggle with election uncertainty and US-China tensions remain elevated, it’s likely to be a bumpy ride.”

&gt; Out of all the indicators we monitor, US retail sales had been showing one of the most robust recoveries toward the end of the summer as it exceeded 2019 levels on a year-over-year basis, but the most recent weekly readings from retailers on same-store sales recently slipped back lower than last year (source: Bloomberg, Johnson Redbook). It’s not surprising that consumer confidence levels, as measured by the Bloomberg Weekly Consumer Comfort Index, also dipped on their last reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Driving map routing requests by the Apple maps app exceeded pre-pandemic levels but have since leveled off and is now declining slightly. This real-time indicator steadily recovered from March and April lows as people returned to work or other economic activity, and it’s been continuing at a higher than normal rate as Americans travel by car when they previously may have used public transit or air travel. Public transit usage, as measured by Moovit, is still at only 50% of its baseline level, as working from home has a huge effect on usage numbers in major metropolitan areas.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-6.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Electricity demand is also showing a bumpy recovery. It had recovered, dipped, and then recovered, only to dip again since the start of September. Demand for electricity dropping again potentially indicates a slowdown in the rate at which businesses are reopening or softening demand for their goods and services.

&gt; During the midst of the March lockdowns, the number of diners in US restaurants hit extreme lows of -100% compared to the same time last year. The last reading on this indicator was -45%, coming off a recent peak of -30% on September 7 (source: Opentable). Restaurant bookings could be under pressure as cooler weather makes outdoor dining less comfortable in parts of the country.

&gt; As the seasons change from summer to fall, consumer behavior often changes, too, and the potential for heightened rates of viral transmission grows. We will continue to monitor key high-frequency data and provide updates for clues about the path of the economic recovery as we continue to battle the outbreak of COVID-19 across the globe.

52,A warning (and not an advice) from a loser - stop this right now - wall of text,Catinzahat,1601116284,"I am not a winner; never have been. I am letting you know of this fact because I firmly believe one should look up to winners for guidance and not to losers like me. But I am not here to guide you, I am here to warn you. Was born in US but my thoughtless dad left the country to live in a shithole miles away - took a lot of work to return home. I made one bad decision after another my whole life because my father basically guided me to be a time bomb (when he was around). I thought I could be a winner and so I made some money in the last few months; only to get stepped on real hard in the last few weeks. I was trying to turn the most shittiest and negative time in my life into a positive time. I saw my hair fall out, saw me sit in unemployment phone lines for hours. I deleted my social media and wiped out my contacts because I have no friends left. But when I was making money and browsing WSB daily thread I felt a sense of brotherhood with everyone else in the forum. It was the first time I felt real joy in so long - hell I can't even remember the last time I felt this happy. 

Whatever happiness I acquired by these small wins was instantly squashed by despair. My father made sure to remind me daily that I was losing money, he has been reminding me of shit like this since I was very little. I don't know why the man hates me so much; maybe because I am a retard? that can't be it because I graduated in applied math with a 4.0. I actually had/have a formula with a guaranteed 270% return on certain stock tickers. But what did I do, I took risks and I went into stocks like TSLA. 

Getting back to the warning part and away from the self loathing part - this is bad. This whole thing is real bad. There is one thing that defines our lives and it is the most important thing. Happiness is based on it. Joy relies on it. It is the embodiment of success and you can't feel fulfilled without it. It is control. If you have control you want and need nothing else. And if you don't have control then regardless of what you do have; you will not be happy, successful or fulfilled. You have no control in this stock market as a retail investor. You are basically handing your entire savings to a stranger. You are a kite dancing in the fucking storm. 

Believe it or not but not all rich people are evil. Elon Musk is a good hearted guy at the core. He didn't just give us electric cars and trucks - he's done some great work in the past. Elon Musk knows why his company is valued so high right now. It is because it's a trap for retail investors and the like. He knew there was a strong pull down coming during and after the event and so he tried to warn people ahead of time. His hands are tied by the SEC so he can't just tell people ""My stock is being used for pump and dump schemes to take unemployment money away from retail investors"". So he has been leaving subtle messages. He also doesn't want his stock to be used to ruin so many lives. With this whole Trevor Milton shit going on - it affects his reputation too because when a stock drops overnight usually people hate the CEO and not the bankers or market makers - we can't see the bankers or the market makers we can only see Elon Musk. Elon Musk has also drawn the hatred of people who have controlled our planet for the last 30-40 years - the gas and oil sector. It is also in their best interest to ruin as many investors as they can under the name of Tesla. We don't know what some of these big rug pullers are up to behind the scenes. If it weren't for his tweets I bet we would have lost much more money.

Musk is an engineer. His presentation was decent. He is not an art gallery person like Steve Jobs so you can't expect him to sing and dance through a presentation. Their battery tech is revolutionary no question about it, it will save people a good bit of money and energy. Once they start making $25,000 cars they will bring in a ton of revenue. Musk also talked about his factory technology because he knows how high the demand for his own vehicles is and how he plans to keep up with the production. Their factories will have technology that no one else on the planet does. But the stock took a dive anyways. Why? because the valuation is not based on future earnings or current capability. Right now Tesla is valued more than all the other car companies combined and it barely produces more vehicles than one of them. It is a big deal in northern Europe but northern Europe isn't under the clutches of the energy sector like the US and the rest of the world is. Even with revolutionary technology and the best gadgets it will still be a long time before Tesla reaches current valuation, and that won't be before a hard rug pull comes and puts all the Tesla investors back few years. Long term investors and companies can deal with this, but small people will get hit with margin calls and they will not survive an event like that. Many other stocks have the same problem (ZM might be an example though ZM doesn't have the future potential like Tsla of course). Me? I am going back to my old formula days and I have gained back 10% of my losses from last few weeks already. I will not be going into risky stocks until things settle down.  I like Elon Musk I really do. I believe in his vision and want him to succeed. In a parallel universe where I had a better life and made the right decisions; I work for him. But I will wait until his stock has more stability and it is valued where it should be before I mess with it.

Also remember that many of the posts on WSB are also written by people who want you to get trapped in these positions. Don't ruin yourself to feel happy, find another outlet. This is not our game, we are not in control. The best you can do is make little bit here and there or invest long term. This market is worse than the casinos because the algorithms are literally designed to trap people. It is in their design to do the opposite of what we want. This is why so many of the bulls and bears are losing every day now - at the same time even.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j03sd3/a_warning_and_not_an_advice_from_a_loser_stop/

91,Question for Finance guys - Do you like your job?,Kommoncents1,1601097456,"First, and man I hate that I have to say this, this question is for individuals working at finance firms in any capacity other than janitorial (not shitting on janitors, they do great work), not the guys who day trade using TA and somehow ended up making 500k this summer. We get it, you guys are sick, and you’re probably going to fuck my girlfriend, but still this question’s not for you. 

I’m an Economics/Political Science major ~about to graduate (Fall 2021), and I’m looking for Finance internships for next summer to get the ball rolling. I live in Baltimore city which has a ton of opportunities in finance - almost as many opportunities as heroin needles and homeless people screaming at the air. 

I’m at a pretty major impasse, and now, in my apathetic depression(ish) post ice cream and chocolate haze I felt compelled to ask all of you for your insights. “Fuck you faggot suck your girlfriends boyfriends dick”, yes ok fine but your feedback would be appreciated first. 

I’m 24, and not going to graduate till halfway through 25. I’m so late to finish my bachelors bc 1. I was a ~prescribed~ Valium/Klonopin addict for the first 3 years of college (18-21) and withdrew basically every semester, and 2. I’ve been going to school part time to work/save money and get life and other faggotry back on track. I’m good with numbers and good with people (been in sales jobs all my life). Problem with “good with people” is even though I’ve always done well in sales, it has burnt me out. I found myself actually relating to shitty memes posted by my friends (‘I hate people so much...’) from high school that never graduated community college whose pages are littered with them being filmed by their 12 year old stepbrothers shotgunning Natty’s, and of course, shitty memes. 

So, I thought to myself mid-DD on fucking STNG four months ago fully certain I had “figured it out”, finance may be the place for me instead! I’ve always been “gifted” in math (until I realized how fucking smart really smart people are, not just smart according to my grandparents and the retards I hang around), and enjoyed calculus greatly (my 104% in the class made me feel like I may actually be talented; yes this is a flex and a weak one but let me have it, I’ll self deprecate more later). This led me to the whole “Finance could be a good fit for me”. I have a bunch of friends who work for Morgan Stanley, and the consensus among them is - it’s ok, nothing terrible, nothing fascinating. 

Any finance guys here with any takes on that? Do you enjoy your jobs? Anyone have similar experiences with sales and went to finance and found it to be better? What do you guys hate, and what do you guys love about working in finance? I know there are a TON of different jobs in the field, and I’m generalizing to such a degree that I’m reading the comments calling me a retard in my mind already; do you enjoy your specific department in a finance firm, what is it, why, how did you get there?

Regardless of my wacky transcript (tons of W’s), my GPA is solid (3.4) and will continue to go up before I graduate. I’ve got a good resume; lots of solid work experience and involved in academic clubs etc. Any advice applying to places mid-COVID times? Do I need to be spectacular to get a finance job/internship in this climate?

Finally - I have about 30k saved up, besides the obligatory student loan debt (30k, net even). It’s not a ton, but it’s a lot for me; I pulled myself up out of about 10k of CC debt at a certain point. I was saving to go on a 7 month bicycle trip around the country (US, *insert something mean about Europe here*) before COVID hit. I did a 3 month bicycle trip in 2017 and it was the best thing that’s ever happened to me - got me clean, showed me the world (*once again something mean about anywhere other than US*), interviewed a lot of fascinating people for a book I’ll never finish, and most importantly got me clean. Do I still go on the 7 month bicycle trip post graduation, or am I running too late in the finance world, age-wise? 

Any and all sarcastically serious answers welcome. Truly curious what you guys think. 

Thanks.

If you have 2 hours out of your week you too can eat round meals for 25$ a week. don't fake yourself. that 25$ doesn't deserve to be in your RH account. yet. Listen.

Beef Stew. 

buy 1 pound stew beef, potatoes, onions, celery, carrots, flour, beef bouillon, for all the bulls that eventually get fucked by the bears, and for the bears who get dropped by the bulls

coat those bull meats with a mixture of flour, salt, and pepper. 

get a damn skillet, you adult, and brown the meat on all sides over medium high heat, or #8 if thats how you understand it. 

you have a large pot right? if you don't grow the fuck up and expect the dips. Sorry, cant always eat tendies. In due time fam. In due time.

put those cooked bull pieces in the pot, then use 3 quarts of water, and 4 cubes or 2 spoonfuls of beef bouillon. bring it to a boil.

once its boiling, turn it to a SIMMER. walk away. for one  WHOLE hour walk away. paper trade or something. 

one hours up. I hope you diced those potatoes. if you did, throw 2 papas in the pot. Now you wait 30 minutes. 

AFTER 30 MINUTES. I bet you forgot to slice the celery and carrots. while you're at that dice that onion. throw it in there. 

WAIT another 30 MINUTES.

its been two hours. you're thinking , ""what next?""

get that flour, use a half a cup of it. mix it with boiling water to get rid of the chunks. Toss it where?

&amp;#x200B;

In the pot. 

&amp;#x200B;

salt and pepper. however much you want. 

serve. 

this is a bull/bear neutral food strat.

the average American spends 54$ a week on groceries. therefor you have a savings of 30$. you'll be earning tendies again not long after that, then spread the word of the stew to others bleeding the red.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/izzygb/when_at_a_loss_eat_like_a_peasant_king/
94,Never Buy SPY Options Again,Stonks134,1601097152,"You need to buy puts on either the SPXL if you think the S&amp;P will decline or buy puts on SPXS if you think the S&amp;P will rise. These are both 3X Daily leveraged ETFs that experience high levels of decay (SPXS 3X the inverse of the S&amp;P and SPXL 3X the S&amp;P). In other words Since these are leveraged daily, they have to rebalance their complicated holdings everyday which causes them to drop in a week that the S&amp;P breaks even. Therefore even if the S&amp;P just breaks even (hurting the value of your SPY options) your puts would rise. This actually worked out for me when on September 23, I bought a SPXS put for $2. SPY actually went .1 percent by the time I exited. If I bought a Spy call my call would have declined mostly due to Theta decay as well as the slight share price decline, However due to the SPXS’s own decay it swung my position to a profit, I sold my call for $2.02.

The companies disclosed in Friday’s document that they have fielded two requests for additional information from the Department of Justice, the latest on Sept. 9

As part of the Uber-Postmates agreement, Uber agreed to loan Postmates up to $100 million in operating expenses for the next 12 months; if the deal does not go through, Uber agreed to pay a $145.8 million breakup fee minus whatever amount had already been loaned with interest

According to the filing, Uber and Postmates walked away from talks about a possible merger in July of 2019, with Uber making a preliminary bid of a $1.9 billion valuation. Postmates received two offers from special purpose acquisition companies, one aiming for a $2.3 billion valuation and another for a $2.5 billion valuation, in early June.

8,CVCO OG Fucking DD,applejuicefarmer,1601092414,"Alright faggots, listen up.

CVCO is Cavco industries, a homebuilding company specializing in producing ""manufactured homes,"" AKA fucking bullshit compared to the prefab home industry. They've been struggling against competitors since their business model is bullshit (google it) compare to SKY and DHI. DHI is the biggest homebuilder for a reason and it sure as fuck isn't the same as CVCO. They basically build on site as compared to prefab//don't have the same economies of scale as the bigger guys, and no differentiating factors to boot. They've been swimming and their board knows it.

What's even worse is that they've been breaking their financials to make ends meet, and the SEC is about to fuck them. The investigation has been going on for two years so you know they've gathered a TON of shit. The SEC loves to build a solid case before hammering it home, so this is to be expected.

Here's the thing. CVCO trades with a pussy, shit amount of volume. Basically none. What does this mean? Information is reported way less frequently than with other shares, especially given what the fuck is going on with my lord and savior donny T. Anyway a good example of this is to just search WSB for CVCO - there's like a single other post, ever. That's nothing. Lucky for you faggots is I follow all SEC updates very closely to stay on top of big opps like this.

So, get this. Friday morning CVCO released an update to their SEC investigation started in November of 2018. This is the first major update to the investigation since its launch which caused the stock to drop 25%. The headline of the update is that the company is starting settlement talks, but the real news is that their current CFO is stepping down because he is now being charged by the SEC. This is the same CFO who took over as interim CEO when the investigation started and the original CEO got canned. Additionally, he ran the internal investigation that supposedly cleared the company of all wrongdoing. Everyone is involved and this is just the start.

Over the next few months, this company is gonna fall the fuck apart. There's no way you can charge one C-suite without the rest, at least in a situation like this. Before you know it the SEC is gonna have the CEO, CFO, COO all on fucking raptors while they tear CVCO down to the sub $100 mark (currently trading like 170).

So what's the move? Buy puts as hard as possible and short the fuck out of it. Personally i'm short 80k right now, mix 70% shares and 30% puts (i know i'm a bitch and won't lever up more but fuck off).

I stumbled on this page at the start of September when I was thinking about how rich people = stock market, and I want to be Rich so, stock market. But also to pass the time because literally all I do is read Reddit.(help) 

This page didn’t only just have the most retarded advice I’ve ever read, but also you guys used to call eachother retard and autistic and that made me LOL OMG. It used to be so original. And soooo smart. You used to be able to find 500+ IQ plays like “buy the dip”. Not something the average r/investing user would be able to comprehend. To be fair I don’t understand any of it either, and I’m a pussy who doesn’t make any plays, but I like the feeling of superiority that comes with being non PC and cheering on dumb shit. 

Now it’s all “I’m down 20$”(I lose that in one night at bingo, wtf?) and Elon suck fest( I like putting my points in parentheses) the worst DD I’ve had the misfortune of coming across(LAC, VALE) and the least intelligent conversation I’ve ever seen. Now I can’t rub my neck beard and laugh about stonks(again more parentheses because obviously you retards can’t infer my point) 

Now I can’t claim to be an original bitch and moaner about the state of this sub, yet I can clearly see how since I got here it’s gotten so much worse, and people a year ago said it was bad, and two years ago people were also saying it was bad, so I’m probably right and not just retarded. Add to the discussion and call someone autistic and stop asking what a tendie is retard. ( did i mention me and parentheses like to hook up and fuck out my point?) 

TL:DR literally nobody fucking cares. The only people who go to a sub and then months later complain about the state of said sub are meta cucks who want to feel overly superior to anybody new, because they were here when it was good and now it’s dog shit. If it’s true? Congrats here’s your cookie for being first on the cool sub train. Fuck off, if it’s not true?

I stumbled on this page at the start of lockdown when I was thinking about getting in the stock market. Not for the tendies, but for something to pass the time with the un-BEAR-able boredom that came with a lockdown.

This page didnt only have solid DD that occasionally was worth the punt but actually made me LOL with the shithousery that took place here, along with some genuinely funny (and original) lingo and comments. Epic loss porn, plays that made hedge fund managers look like soft handed home schoolers, interesting (while occasionally autistic) financial conversations, and a level of intellect that you dont find in a lot of subreddit's.

Now its ""down $500 in a month"" (I lose that in a night at the actual casino, how am I supposed to jerk off to that kindergarten porn), an Elon cuckfest (theres more than one ticker out there), the worst DD I've had the misfortune of coming across (you're 'gut feeling' isnt DD) and the least intelligent discourse I've ever seen (fuck you, you're retarded).

Now I can't claim to be an original WSBer, yet I can still clearly see the cesspool of inbred delinquents with literally no money that have taken over this page. And stop asking for beginner tips, that's not what this page is for. Add to the discussion or go to r/options you fucking retards (who claim to be autists but ask what Delta is).

81,"Tesla Stock Is Going To Go Up Next Week, And Here's Why.",Educational_Ear_6275,1601079820," 

[Tesla](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TSLA) investors are [experiencing](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-stock-market-has-a-tesla-problem-51600963241) an unusual [down month](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-stumbles-and-the-rest-of-the-electric-vehicle-industry-follows-51600890950) for the stock, but news that could send it higher again is coming soon. In about a week, the company will report how many electric cars it delivered in the third quarter.

[September](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-this-is-not-a-september-to-remember-51600948475) has been a lousy month for Tesla (ticker: TSLA). Shares fell 22%, as of Thursday’s closing price, as a widely anticipated update on the company’s battery technology failed to wow investors. The decline is worse than Tesla’s 21% drop in March when the entire market was plummeting because of the coronavirus.

It might have been impossible for any company to [live up to the expectations](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-battery-day-cost-savings-increased-production-51600818909) for Battery Day. Tesla shares rose 74% in August, partly in anticipation.

Wall Street’s analysis of the event fell along [party lines](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-falls-battery-day-what-wall-street-is-saying-technology-51600866911). Bearish analysts wrote that the event was too full of aspirations and light on news that will affect shares in the near term. Bullish analysts wrote that Tesla’s lead in battery technology was accelerating and that the day gave them more confidence the company would be delivering millions of vehicles annually in a few years.

 That event is now in the rearview mirror and third-quarter deliveries—a proxy for sales—are the next thing to watch. Shares rallied more than 13% in early July after second-quarter delivery numbers [blew by](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teslas-deliveries-were-incredible-the-stock-is-flying-51593692989) Wall Street expectations that had been dragged lower by concern over how much the pandemic would [hurt production.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-fremont-factory-reopening-coronavirus-deliveries-earnings-51589808002)

The strong number raised hope that Tesla would report a profit in the second quarter—a prerequisite for the company being included in the [S&amp;P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/SPX) index. That, in turn, could have brought more gains because funds that track the S&amp;P 500 would have had to buy the stock.

(Tesla produced the required profit and still [wasn’t added](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-didnt-join-the-s-p-500-but-three-others-did-51599255574).)

Less drama is attached to the third-quarter numbers than came with prior [delivery releases](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q2-2020-vehicle-production-deliveries). Both of Telsa’s factories—in California and China—are open. What’s more, analysts expect profitability will be easier to achieve than in the second quarter, tamping down the impact of any S&amp;P 500 index-related surprises.

Wall Streets expects the company will deliver about 141,000 cars during the third quarter. Estimates range from 123,000 to 161,000.

Until recently, FactSet—an aggregator of Wall Street forecasts—listed an estimate of 190,000 vehicles as one of the figures used to produce its consensus numbers. That was skewing the average a little, but the estimate vanished this week. Removing the 190,000 figure dropped the average estimate by about 3,000 vehicles.

The current quarter is expected to be a record for Tesla by a wide margin. The company delivered 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2019—the current record—before the pandemic hit.

Analysts expect the company to deliver about [483,000 cars](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-owns-the-u-s-electric-vehicle-market-analyst-says-why-it-will-own-china-and-europe-too-51590761583) in 2020, up from 368,000 in 2019. That’s an impressive feat given the global economic recession. [Ford Motor](https://www.barrons.com/quote/F) (F), for instance, is expected to sell about 4.2 million vehicles in 2020, down from 5.4 million in 2019.

The relative performance is reflected in stock prices. Ford shares are down 28% year to date, worse than comparable returns of the S&amp;P 500 and [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/DJIA). Tesla stock, on the other hand, is up about 380% year to date.

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American Airlines [AAL.O](https://www.reuters.com/companies/AAL.O) said on Friday it has secured a $5.5 billion government loan and could tap up to $2 billion more in October depending on how the U.S. Treasury allocates extra funds under a $25 billion loan package for airlines.

Airlines have until Sept. 30 to decide whether to take the U.S. Treasury loans, which were authorized under the CARES Act coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress in March.

American Airlines was originally allocated $4.75 billion, but carriers including Delta Air Lines [DAL.N](https://www.reuters.com/companies/DAL.N) and Southwest Airlines [LUV.N](https://www.reuters.com/companies/LUV.N) have already said they do not intend to take their share of the package, opening the door for the funds to be used by other airlines. 

Fort Worth, Texas-based American said it has already drawn down $550 million of the Treasury loan, which is backed by its loyalty program. The loans also require airlines to issue warrants and carry restrictions on executive compensation and buybacks.

Among other carriers, United Airlines [UAL.O](https://www.reuters.com/companies/UAL.O) said this week it will tap the Treasury loans, but it was not clear whether the airline would only seek its $4.5 billion shares or more.

U.S. airlines received a separate $25 billion in March under the CARES Act primarily in the form of grants to keep employees on the payroll through the end of this month and avoid furloughs while the industry battles a deep downturn from the coronavirus pandemic.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/izve7q/american_airlines_secures_55_billion_treasury/

*Where dreams die. Slowly*

Alright, folks, hop aboard and keep the butt cheeks clenched tight because we’re about to re-live the drama of Boomerland for the week.

$X (US Steel) might be the coolest ticker on the street but it also carries the distinction of being one of the worst still-traded performers ever and this week it completely shit the bed. -15.76%. Fun fact: in June of 2008, the stock was trading at 196. Now? Well, it ain’t much; maybe we should just talk about it’s glory days and shove some more of that Boomer money their way.

Speaking of dramatically poor-performing companies, GE, maker of dishwashers and airplane parts, took a bit of a tumble this week after investors woke up from the inexplicable trance they were in last week. It closed on Friday down -7.8% for the week. It’s hard to believe but that bitch is flirting with the 5s again. And most of that movement happened before the piss poor durable goods numbers were released. 

KO, after defending the 50.00 mark last week, stayed true to last weeks’ Spartan-at-the-Hot-Gates-of-Thermopylae analogy and was ultimately overran by market forces. Closed the week down -2.5% to 48.50.

UL (Unilever), maker of pretty much everything I guess, stunned the world by doing nothing different than it did all summer. Hung on to 60. Closed the week out +1.45% as the world around it either imploded or launched.

F came in at -7.64% for the week. Pay respects. 

Banks showed a bit more independent movement than they have been as of late. As expected, the bank that got slapped with a billion dollar fine for cheating (JPM) fared significantly better than a few who didn’t (BAC for instance). There’s a lesson in there, I think: just because it’s illegal and you get caught, it doesn’t mean it wasn’t profitable. 

CSCO, on the shortlist of China’s shitlist, was straight up not having a good time as it not only failed to make a measurable rebound from last quarters’ fumbled guidance, but gave up another -2.5% on the week. 

Now let’s take a brief minute to talk about bonds. Just kidding; fuck that noise. Hope you enjoyed this week’s tour through Boomerland for the week ending September 25th, 2020. It was mostly just carnage. Enjoy your weekend .",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/izu3i0/the_boomer_weekly_september_25_2020/

Dollar was not quite as close to 95 as I expected today given equities are flying high and breaking the downward channel. 

The only reason the DX didn't melt down was because stimulus 'might happen' and it 'DIDN'T happen'. Another 2.4 trillion added to the money supply will kick the dollar hard, no worries if this does happen, which will likely be good for equities. 

Europe's still in deflation, I'm holding my short until eur/usd hits 1.15ish depending on price action and trump bucks getting printed. 

If you're a 🌈🐻 like me and were finger painting shit on the wall when your puts dried up screaming ""DOLLAR UP WHY STONKS UP?!' well this is why.

18,Watch out for Wednesday: Technicals + opinion on indices,jzhang396,1601062624,"The S&amp;P 500 has shown bearish trends, with a series of lower highs and lower lows since the beginning of September. There is potential for a reversal, given the S&amp;P defended the 100 day MA.

I specify wednesday because on the 30th the fed releases new estimates for Q2 GDP. This could be negative news that brings the indexes into a downward breakout, given recent signs of a slowing recovery via upticks in initial unemployment claims and lower durable goods orders. 

Here is my attempt at technical analysis showing a descending triangle from the recent highs, and a support line that extends from the beginning of the year.

[Someone buy me tradingview premium](https://preview.redd.it/8uzxfn77jcp51.png?width=1324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a25d7ddeeb3c5c9ae7e5f2ff96cfd62dfcf24051)

The S&amp;P has rallied strong today, but looking at the clock this Friday, it may close at or slightly below 3300. If the S&amp;P goes green Monday, this will be a substantial move up to the channel the S&amp;P hovered in for the first half of the month. Otherwise, the descending triangle pattern will continue, meaning the S&amp;P will get squeezed towards 3200, then break through the 3200 support on economic news next week. (I am a  🌈🐻)

TLDR S&amp;P go up September 25, go back down September 28 and break through 3200 support by the end of September.

The Bears would argue that this \~37% move to the upside was the entire short squeeze, but while there may have been some short covering along that move from $7 to $9, I believe that this thing is still stretched on the short side and there is still substantial upside opportunity.

[Short float is continuing to rise regardless of price action](https://preview.redd.it/x36bzuclhcp51.png?width=1370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d21faacffe8cee2ae0114d6b535996bc2cc78f6)

High short interest is not a new concept for GME, but it is important to look at the behavior of the bears relative to the price action leading up to this price move. Looking back at the short float from the end of July we can attempt to gain some insight into the mentality of the short sellers. In the first half of August as the price shot up more than 65% the overall short float rose by 2.2%, then again in the back half of August the short float rose by an additional 3.9% despite a 26% decline in price.

This means that the bears appear to be operating under the assumption that GME is going to crash below $4 and ultimately go to 0. They see a rising price as an opportunity to short it at a higher price and they are not taking gains off the table when the stock pulls back as it did in the back half of August. This means that there is still a lot of overconfidence and greed on the short side of the GME trade, both things that point to a potentially massive short squeeze.

Now let look at that latest short float update from the 15th of September that was just released yesterday. In first half of September the share price rose by 17%, and the short float sky rocketed an additional 15%! This means that as the stock rose above $7 a share the short float rose to an astounding 136%! For those that don't know, this means that every single share of GameStop stock has been borrowed to be sold short and a third of them have been borrowed to be short a second time this is the exact conditions we want to see for a good long and hard short squeeze!

[SLB Rate represents the annual interest that Bears are paying to borrow shares](https://preview.redd.it/t5d6g0sqhcp51.png?width=1657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f7dc15308e3da6532f5ffcfbd48c97b2dbb2f44)

Looking at the stock borrowing prices as a proxy for short volume over the last 10 days, we can see that while the borrowing rates did drop between the 17th and the 23rd they have stabilized and are rising again. This means that while there was some short covering that pushed the stock temporarily up to $11, I believe that there is still a massive short interest open in GME and as the console sales + holiday season roll on there is much potential for positive surprises that will trigger a violent move to the upside that will lead to the real forced buying that comes with a true short squeeze.

The energy output of the sun is responsible for ending the last ice age. As the receding glaciers cut the Earth's crust, steep hills were formed and each hill represents a source of energy generation for Nikola vehicles.


Currently, hills represent only 23% of the earth's terrestrial surface (1). But if Nikola works to contribute towards Climate Change, the likelihood for dramatic geographic change (mud-slides, ice ages, erosion from rising sea levels) will increase. With just a few decades of large-scale carbon production, Nikola could reach 67% of landmass covered by declining slopes.

19,Invitae ($NVTA) Mega Thread (Cathie Ark's 2nd Largest Holding Under Tesla) 5X YOLO,InfamousBreadfruit99,1601052605,"Hello and welcome to this mega thread on all things Invitae. 

Key Points:

**1. Cathie Ark owns 20% of the company and it's her 2nd largest holding, just a few million less than Tesla.**

[https://whalewisdom.com/filer/ark-investment-management-llc#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/ark-investment-management-llc#tabholdings_tab_link)

**2. There is still a 20% short float betting** ***against*** **Cathie Ark.**

I highly doubt Cathie Ark would make this her 2nd largest position without such high conviction and after reading their analysts DD on twitter and their white papers I'm convinced this is going to Mars once the short float get's squeezed out. **Triple digits. Multibagger. Mars mission type of squeeze.** 

If there was ever a good YOLO, it's to bet Cathie Ark is right and the short float is wrong. **This is my #1 YOLO** and gonna keep reminding you retards about it until the short float capitulates. I'll also post updates regarding Invitae on this thread.

24,Long GME (a balance sheet DD),dummyinasuit,1601051769,"Everyone knows GME has one of the highest short interests on the market, so I'll skip the banter about a potential short squeeze. There have been several DD's on GME this month so I just wanted to provide another perspective that gives evidence to the fact that the risk/reward on the LONG side is very attractive. 

Let's take a look at GME's balance sheet as of 2Q20.

https://preview.redd.it/5s7xoxo8mbp51.png?width=1662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edf72617aceef6cc36e90c89c0284d69ba036c7f

As you can see above, GME has $735.1MM of cash on hand, $221.3MM of short-term debt, and $215.9MM of long-term debt. That means GME has a net cash position of $297.9M! If GME were to stop all operations, shut down all stores, and never sell a console again, equity value would be the value of cash less debt, or $297.9M. At the time of writing this post, GME's market cap is $638.7M. The market is implying that GME's future earnings are worth $340.8M (in other words, the current market cap minus net cash position). 

Now, it is clear that GME's core business is in the shitter. Let's not deny that. Revenue continues to decline as disc sales disappear, and gross margins are trending down due to many factors including mix shift (consoles are lower GM% than discs), but there are some bright spots over the next 6 months. For one, a new console cycle is just beginning and when GME makes it to 4Q20, there will be a nice revenue bump that can send shorts screaming. Then you introduce the activist attention. I worked at HF for several years and if there's one thing I learned, it's that it's very hard to short an activist. They can make a lot of noise and even if results don't follow, the higher probability of success results in a higher multiple. In this case, we even may see results in 4Q, and even if they aren't a result of an activist, it will get people excited (or spooked in the case of short sellers). 

GME $12C 10/30exp for the short-term juice, GME $22C 1/15/21exp for the 4Q bump.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/izmt4l/long_gme_a_balance_sheet_dd/

&amp;#x200B;

people believe this guy who repeatedly makes promises he can't keep. here are a few lists of them:

[http://elonsbrokenpromises.com/](http://elonsbrokenpromises.com/)

[https://www.elonmusk.today/](https://www.elonmusk.today/)

&amp;#x200B;

this post will focus on just a few of the promises. he has been saying he will make a sub-$30k car in 3-4 years, and no one does anything about it when he fails to deliver. It has been almost 15 years since he first made this claim.

[Article written in 2006](https://www.autoblog.com/2006/12/18/san-jose-mercury-news-interviews-teslas-elon-musk/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLm5vLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM6BwBhfhU8lzslvmztxbJUzoZsQou7m42mGbihhqGPs8bJVqSY9sTEZdZ0lIh5tZWBR2VtAwcWOr-PqH5yAK2rvjIVUwBs1voLHYDlRbcOAu67QFjbGE9GiVExPEAXLkThgQO-XdQiF6fNDlUmgyfkgo4w56CIPnymXp-coRy_L): By 2010 he wants to have a range of three models including one costing only $30,000

[Article written in 2011](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1053971_teslas-challenge-build-30k-mainstream-electric-car-by-2015): Build a $30,000 electric car in under four years. That’s the promise made last night by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. 

They gave up on making a $30,000 car (except for the limited time where California gave $7k to people buying EVs), so they decided to make an even more ridiculous goal.

[Article written in 2018](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/18/elon-musk-tesla-could-produce-a-25000-car-in-3-years--.html): Tesla’s CEO estimates the company could produce a model at a $25,000 price point in perhaps three years.

[Article written this week](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/business/tesla-elon-musk-battery-day.html): Elon Musk Promises to Make a $25,000 Tesla (in 3 Years)

&amp;#x200B;

how is this allowed? they can make promises for 2-3 years out, market reacts now. and when they can't meet promises just make even bigger promises? and what's the excuse when it doesn't work out ""this stuff isn't easy \[even though a few years ago I said it was very easy\]""

They went through ""[multiple levels of hell](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-price-tesla-is-in-its-third-stage-of-hell-with-model-3-2019-3-1028032448#)"" trying to meet their car delivery quotas (which were delayed by several years). and their car manufacturing process is no better than any other auto OEM from what I can tell (margins are similar if you exclude regulatory credits). even though they promised autonomous factories, it turns out ""[humans are underrated](https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/04/16/elon-musk-replaces-robots-at-tesla-factory-humans-are-underrated/)"" and manufacturing is hard

and now they're expected to become battery producers (right now Panasonic makes their batteries) with fully autonomous factories? but that's not all, they will become lithium producers too??

&amp;#x200B;

a few more promises which I am 100% positive they will not make:

[Article from 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/22/elon-musk-says-tesla-robotaxis-will-hit-the-market-next-year.html): the CEO repeated that Tesla will have over 1 million robotaxis on the road next year,  and he expects to be “operating robotaxis next year with no one in them""

Two months left in 2020 to release the robotaxis, what will the excuse be this time? He has one excuse right now, lack of regulatory approval for something that doesn't exist: [""Functionality still looking good for this year. Regulatory approval is the big unknown.""](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1249210220200550405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) 

I'm guessing there's a 95% chance they don't meet the goal, and a 5% chance they will release a gimped version of their FSD robotaxi software that doesn't work and will be disabled because ""they don't have regulatory approval"".

&amp;#x200B;

But, what will regulators even approve if they haven't even achieved fully autonomous driving:

[Interview in 2017](https://blog.ted.com/what-will-the-future-look-like-elon-musk-speaks-at-ted2017/):  Musk says that Tesla is on track for completing a fully autonomous, cross-country LA to New York trip by the end of 2017 

[July of this year](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-tesla-autonomous/tesla-very-close-to-level-5-autonomous-driving-technology-musk-says-idUKKBN24A0HT):  “I remain confident that we will have the basic functionality for level 5 autonomy complete this year.”

But currently, from what I can tell, Tesla is only at Level 2 autonomy. and some say Tesla is at the back of the pack when it comes to self driving [Article from March 2020](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/self-driving-study-navigant-research-tesla-waymo-cruise/)\- [Image from the article](https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/gD975RIRUAQf_yySZot6bgqQRlY=/2020/03/13/4246ad6b-2712-422a-908b-3c0450ca138e/2020-navigant-av-leaderboard.jpg)

They're expected to go to Level 5 autonomy, from this? (video taken in June 2020)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfmAG4dk-rU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfmAG4dk-rU)

Positions: I have no positions in Tesla. I think it's price is $350 higher than it should be. But it won't go down until the 🤡s stop buying.

**Cash/Assets/Liabilities:** GME cash position increased 47% this year due to their new CEO's moves. Sherman has been selling non-performing assets and have reduced the liabilities by 10% as well, trying to weather the virus event as much as possible for a brick and mortar business. He has reduced their net loss from 816 million a year to 554 a year. Essentially GME can afford to stay open another year and a half as it is right now and still stay open without doing any more changes, but, more shit is coming now that Cohen is on board.

On 9/22/2020 GME appeared on the **SEC Threshold list.** What is this and why is it important?

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp)

Key Takeaways

A threshold list is a list of securities **that failed to settle** in the previous five trading days.

They are published by various exchanges in accordance with SEC regulations.

These settlement failures may be **indicative of naked short selling**, although they may also be caused by benign factors, such as administrative errors.

What is naked short selling? 

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp)

Illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. Despite being made illegal after 2008 financial crisis naked shorting continues due to certain loopholes. 

On 9/24/2020 the **Uptick Rule was triggered and comes into effect for GME on 9/25/2020.** 

**Understanding the Uptick Rule**

The Uptick Rule prevents sellers from accelerating the downward momentum of a securities price already in sharp decline. By entering a short-sale order with a price above the current bid, a short seller ensures that an order is filled on an uptick. The uptick rule prevents MM and short sellers from essentially doing this. 

  

**Potential Catalysts:**

Share buybacks

[The last time they bought shares back was in October 2019 and it resulted in a 30&amp;#37; spike in a month.](https://preview.redd.it/exdgc2pajbp51.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e2022f97a1e2b3121bdf433fc81c2026a8e1a7c)

&amp;#x200B;

[OCT 2019 Spike](https://preview.redd.it/42sschyfjbp51.png?width=197&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6588395574b74d52de511932d9bd964600a5330b)

  

**Ryan Cohen:**

Mr. Cohen had previously been CEO of Chewy, which he took from the ground up to the largest online retailer for pet goods. He knows how to get a company profitable and then sell it at a huge profit.

He's had absolutely nothing to do for 2 years and his other 2 biggest investments before disclosing his shares in GME are in Apple and Wells Fargo, both of which are too big for him to buy outright, but GME only has a marketcap of 654 or so million, so he's in luck. He can buy the whole thing and take it private if he wants to. My personal opinion is that he wants to become CEO. 

**Michael Burry:**

Mr. Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, could decide to buy shares to force the squeeze and then his options and share are worth hundreds of millions. He has enough capital to do this by himself if he wanted. 

[https://cheaperthanguru.com/portfolio/michael-burry?order=value](https://cheaperthanguru.com/portfolio/michael-burry?order=value)

Burry's Portfolio is here. We dont know what options he is holding, but he currently holds 2.75m shares.

Q2 earnings beat was a $10 bump to share price and that was just after the reverse Halo effect on the Corona seltzer line (which was 'priced' in to the shares). It has been a huge winner this summer and sales on that line will add to an earnings beat. Not to mention their ability to deliver cheap wines (Kim Crawford, Prisoner Line, etc).

I am relatively new to this type of trading and I'm unfamiliar with the pros and cons with this choice of investment. If you guys could explain on why dividend stocks is a good or bad idea, that would be appreciated. 

What are some good dividend stocks and what kind of returns on investments should I be expecting? When investing in dividend stocks, is it a trade off between future growth and the dividend payments?

&amp;#x200B;

**Call to Action – Buy shares and callas asap. GME is already up 6% today. Let’s stick it to the big money Market Makers and make them have the biggest short squeeze in history.** 

&amp;#x200B;

DD- Here is the short of it – Market Makers can sell short securities that they don’t even own or are able to borrow. This is called Naked Short Selling and is technically illegal except under some very narrow circumstances. What happens later is they are then unable to deliver these securities at settlement date and have a very short window to buy and deliver these securities. The expectation is that the Market Makers will buy these shares at a better price and can make additional money. 

I looked at the data available [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) and found that on 8/25 when there was a huge up day there were 347k shares that resulted in Failure to Deliver.  20200825|36467W109|GME|347372|GAMESTOP CORP (HLDG CO) CL A|4.87 

If this happens often enough you are placed on a Threshold Securities List. GME has been on this list 9/22, 9.23 and 9/24. I expect them to be on the list again today.  [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

Cliff Notes – 

· Huge Short Squeeze happening

· Large Investors – Burry from The Big Short and Cohen founder of Chewy locking up about 15.3% together along with a few other large hedge funds Hestia Capital Partners and Permit Capital Enterprise

· Cohen is going to act as a change agent to revitalize their business and write Gamestop Business Plan 2.0

· New Console cycle with PS5, Xbox Series X and Switch 2 next year

· Entering Christmas Shopping season.

· Book Value of Stock is about $12/share based on hard assets like cash.

While you fucking retards are fruitlessly chasing Tesla tendies, praying on the whims of the whales, you’re stepping right over all the little nuggets along the way. Small companies will always have more value to you “professional day traders” than any of the big name slot machine tickers. Their humble size is their biggest strength, not because they have some untapped potential to moon or they happen to be some diamond in the rough, just the opposite in fact. These companies are quite fragile, most rely on just a few clients, largely government and corporate contracts. But one wrong move, and their entire income is in jeopardy.
Take Digital Ally (DGLY) for instance: They specialize in body cam and dash cam equipment for law enforcement applications. Despite numerous controversies about the integrity or their equipment, they’ve also been managed about as well as the Cincinnati Bengals. Yet they continue to get away with it because a $5 million market cap, hyper-specialized, tactical equipment company doesn’t draw many flashy headlines. Their most glaring flaw, besides one of their 2 customers being the oh-so-loyal U.S. government, are their absolutely disgusting finances:
&gt; DGLY booked profit margins of -97.30%, and its Return on Assets is -67.50%. (Oracle Dispatch)

21 Reasons You Can’t Get A Girlfriend

There’s a reason for everything and figuring out why you are having trouble landing a girlfriend isn’t always easy.

Besides, if you knew why, you wouldn’t have an issue right?

We are going to uncover oodles of different common and not-so-common reasons why you might be having trouble in the girl department, so you can take action to make positive changes.

After you understand why you are having issues, then you can make a plan to break through your obstacles and find a solution.

ONE – YOU AREN’T TRYING ENOUGH TIMES

If you are serious about getting a girl, you’ve got to step up to the plate and hit it like you mean it. Use as many approaches as you can until you land the girl.

Studies say the majority of guys that can’t get a girlfriend just don’t try enough times. In other words, they give up prematurely.

Guys don’t like rejection and if they ask a girl out and she says no, it often takes months before he’ll try again!

Wrong!

Don’t let the sheer fear of rejection stop you from getting a nice girlfriend.

Rinse and repeat. Ask a girl out and get her phone number. Keep doing it until you get a yes. And try not to be too picky because if one girl isn’t going to work for you, then you owe it to yourself to try another.

TWO – YOU’RE TOO PICKY

Chances are you’ve been looking at too many Victoria Secret magazines and they have painted an unrealistic vision of the perfect girl for you in your brain. Having too many set features or characteristics is going to set you up to fail.

Time for you to open your mind and get real. Step outside your comfort zone and take a second glance at a girl that doesn’t fit your perfect picture.

You never know until you try.

THREE – QUITTERS NEVER WIN

If you’re the type of man that quits too quickly, there’s no wonder you don’t have a girlfriend. Resilience is golden in the dating and relationship department.

Ask a girl out and if she’s busy, that’s fine. You can still ask her out again another time. Have a little patience and persistence; and you’ll be surprised how easy it is to actually get a girlfriend.

Think of it from the girls perspective for a minute. Maybe she needs a little time to warm up to you? Give it a chance by asking her again in a week or so and you just might be pleasantly surprised.

FOUR – YOU LIVE IN YOUR PARENT’S BASEMENT

Sorry boys, if you still live with your parents, that shouts out to the world, you are a loser. Girls don’t want to go out with a boy that lives with mommy and daddy.

If you are working and can afford to live on your own, you better do it quick if you ever want to have a meaningful relationship. Scratch that, if you ever want to have any relationship at all.

When you live on your own, it’s one of the best routes to secure a girlfriend.

FIVE – YOU’RE JUST A NICE GUY

This isn’t a good thing because “nice” guys usually do finish last. If you’re too nice, the girls aren’t going to give you a second glance.

Stop being too nice and you’ve got a chance.

SIX – HYGIENE ISSUES

If you have any kind of hygiene issues, you will never get a girlfriend. Bad breath, dirty clothes, and greasy hair are bad news.

Some girls don’t want a man to be her boyfriend for very specific almost anal reasons, and not taking care of yourself definitely fits the bill.

SEVEN – YOU LET YOUR INSECURITIES GET IN THE WAY

Everyone has things they don’t like about themselves and some things just need to be accepted or changed. Maybe you’ve lost your hair so you’re going to have to just get over that one. But if you are overweight, you can make changes to lose weight and get happy.

Regardless, you are who you are in the now and if you don’t love yourself, you might never get a girlfriend.

Everyone has flaws and that’s no reason not to have a girlfriend, unless of course you let it get in the way.

Look around you. Happy couples come in all different shapes and sizes. Stop letting your insecurities be your excuse.

EIGHT – TRYING TOO HARD TO BE PERFECT

The girls actually like the men who aren’t perfect. You see, when a man seems too perfect, this puts pressure on the girl to try and be perfect too. Then she’s going to get worried she isn’t good enough and that’s enough to make a girl run far and fast the other way.

Think about this one for a minute.

NINE – EXPECTING THE WOMAN TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE

Of course, there are times when a girl initiates the first move but that’s far and few in between.

The Truth is…the majority of women prefer a man to make the first move and if he hasn’t got the balls to do that, she will just move on.

That’s not a challenge, just the truth!

TEN – YOU’RE THE MAN THAT’S ALWAYS LOST IN THE CROWD

If you happen to be the guy that hangs out with popular and super sexy strong men, you will be last in the pecking order. So if the men around you are stronger than you, they are shining brighter and your sweet personality will never been seen much less valued.

Don’t put yourself out at the expense of your friends. You will never ever in a zillion years get a girlfriend, if all the talk is about the friends you hang out with.

Something else to think about.

ELEVEN – YOU HAPPEN TO SHY AWAY FROM ALL THINGS SOCIAL

If you are a social introvert naturally, you’re making it super tough on yourself to get a girlfriend.

Newsflash! If you are serious about getting a girlfriend, you need to step out into the light and go to the social places where girls hangout.

No if’s, and’s, or but’s about this one.

TWELVE – YOU GET STUCK ON YOUR PAST SCREW-UPS!

If you get all crazy about your past mistakes with women, it will interfere with getting a girlfriend in the now.

Yes, it’s natural to think about how you screwed up but if you really want a girl on your arm, you’ve just got to let it go.

Use your past to learn and grow from, not to dwell on with an interference factor.

You are human and you will make mistakes. Let it go and focus on the positive and you will get your girl.

THIRTEEN – YOU HAPPEN TO BE MR. COMPLAINER

If you are a perpetual complainer that yaps on and on about how crappy your life is and how you will never get a girl ever, then you don’t deserve a girlfriend.

Seriously dude! Stop complaining and start talking positive. Your attitude and demeanor will change and trust me, the girls will come.

This one is your choice.

FOURTEEN – YOU JUST DON’T HAVE THE LOGICAL DISCIPLINE TO ASK WOMEN OUT REGULARLY

This is a learning process and you need to sometimes just throw your hat to the wind and go for it.

If you aren’t willing to regularly ask women out, then you are choosing all by yourself to not have a girlfriend. Pretty sad if you ask me.

FIFTEEN – YOU ARE TOO FOCUSED ON WORK FOR ANYTHING ELSE

This one is a no-brainer. If you are working crazy hours and not willing to make time for dating and a girl, you will never have one.

Sadly, there are some men that choose their career over having a girlfriend and in the end, they are left with nothing.

SIXTEEN – YOU’RE TOO CHICKEN TO TELL IT LIKE IT IS

I’m calling you boys out here. If you can’t make yourself a tad vulnerable and let a girl know that you are interested in being more than just friends, you risk the chance of only being friends and nothing more.

What you need to do is step up to the plate and tell this girl you want to kiss her and that you want her to be your girl. When you do this, she’ll either be head over heels receptive or she won’t.

Don’t you think it’s worth it just to find out?

SEVENTEEN – YOU ARE SERIOUSLY OUT OF SHAPE

This doesn’t mean you need to be ripped and have a six-pack! What this means is that you shouldn’t be sporting a beer belly and you should make an effort to have some muscle and a little sexy lean tissue mass.

That is super hot!

You don’t have to be perfect but you need to try.

Truth – When you are in shape, you are showing her you care about your body and that works wonders when you are focused on getting a girl.

Slobs be gone!

EIGHTEEN  – YOU ARE JUST THOUGHT OF AS ICKY

Sorry to say, women do care about looks and that’s something you need to stick into your pipe and smoke it.

Yes, a guy cares way more about how his girl looks, but…Girls care too!

A girl does care about how you look and if you are ugly and a slob, she’s just not going to be your girlfriend no matter how sweet you are. Please understand this before you take one more step forward.

FACT – Guys have it SO much easier than girls. All you need is a clean look and some stubble and you can drive a girl crazy.

Stop your complaining and take action. You will win if you do.

NINETEEN – NO MONEY OR POTENTIAL

There is no doubt that money draws the sweet girls in. I really don’t care what you think, because money is what many girls want.

If you are financially secure, you will get a girlfriend. That might not be fair but that is reality…Trust me.

Women want to be able to go out to a movie or a nice meal without worry. And for bonus if you can take them on a mini vacation without the worry of money, you are golden.

That’s the truth straight up.

TWENTY – THE SAME STUFF ON REPEAT WILL KILL YOU

If you are a programmed creature of habit that never changes his ways, you just aren’t going to have a girlfriend.

Girls are drawn to the strong men that are going to take them on new adventures. The men that will step outside their comfort zone to wow her. End of story.

If you want to find your value and perhaps find a girlfriend for real, you need to drop your walls and open them up to opportunity. Then you need to show her and make it happen.

TWENTY ONE – YOU ARE TOO NEEDY

Girls have no trouble sniffing out the man that is needy and dependent. Secret – That’s a total turn-off.

Women are drawn naturally to men that are confident and sure in themselves. The ones that will make bold decisions and put the girl first.

For sure, girls do not want an insecure man that doesn’t know how to take control and make decisions. There are a zillion fish in the sea…that’s fact.

Step up to the plate if you really want.

FINAL WORDS

If you are trying to figure out why you can’t get a girlfriend, you need to seriously stop and consider the facts.

Look through these tips and pointers and see what applies to you.

Take action to change the attributes you need to in order to find the girl of your dreams. Open your mind and understand there will be a bit of a trial and error process. However, when all is said and done, you will overcome your personal obstacles and get the woman you deserve.

""The bad news keeps piling up for EV truck maker Nikola (NKLA). You could darkly suggest if the company had any of the trucks it has yet to build at its disposal it could load all the negative sentiment and drop it off somewhere out of reach.""

He basically reiterates all of the speculations and concerns surrounding Nikola. He touches on the fact that they don't actually have any products and on top of that their CEO is absolutely out of the picture. 

""Ives’ rating drops from Neutral (i.e. Hold) to Underperform (i.e. Sell), while the price target is severely slashed from $45 to $15. This figure implies a 21% downside from current levels.""

The big point of this article is that he actually steps a price target of $15 for Nikola

Could be below $18 EOD in my opinion.

47,DD: Shipping containers for tendies,SimonatArchimedes,1601037182,"Long on ATCO, and calls on ATCO for next earnings dump.   


# Why shipping containers?

Let's start with the **initial problem**. When COVID hit, everyone smashed the panic button, which largely [affected shipping](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/coronavirus-outbreak-causes-shipping-container-202226200.html) cause a shortage of shipping containers.  


* The first delay we saw was from China, obviously extending their Chinese New Year, shutting down a lot of ports. Workers weren't there to offload a lot of the containers.
* And then manufacturing activity slowed. We saw it down to below 50% of what it was prior to the Chinese New Year, right. So that requires much fewer ships to export much fewer goods.
* Then EU + US drastically slowed down when countries went into lockdown in March and April even when China started their recovery. Ports in the US and EU were idle.
* Shipping companies started offloading their TEUs and not renewing charters because everyone thought the world was going to end in April. Why pay for charters on empty containers if economies and industries are shutdown?

The problem started **carrying over** when the world did not end and the US economy began recovering when everyone started to work from home. Needs for desks and furniture for adults and kids doing remote learning at home + gym supplies and anything in between caused a massive surge in imports. Combined with the COVID stimulus checks, spot rates for containers surged.  
[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/container-rate-records-shattered-us-203428211.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/container-rate-records-shattered-us-203428211.html)  


Remember, a lot of charters were not renewed and so shipping companies had to pay on spot prices for shipping.  


# ATCO

During this period ATCO was buying more capacity on the cheap. They snapped up 13,000 TEUs.  


[From ATCO's recent earnings call](https://preview.redd.it/4lkbkuayeap51.png?width=1598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be04461534ccabced7b2a6a1a37031e0fe62f250)

They have locked in a lot of long-term charters but they have 15% of capacity currently not charters but open to the spot rate. Remember what's happening with spot rate? Tendies coming next q.

57,"Buy the dip in gold but not stocks, say Citi’s global strategists",Educational_Ear_6275,1601034481,"""The Citi team does acknowledge the “central bank put remains intrinsically tied to the equity market,” and that there will be more Treasury bond and credit purchases, and a desire to keep inflation-adjusted interest rates well below 1%.

With all that as a backdrop, the Citi team says “it makes sense to trim some developed market-specific risk at a time when near-term probabilities are skewed to some regional \[economic surprises\] turning negative again, led by Europe.” It advises rotating from European to emerging-market equities [**EEM,** **-0.46%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/EEM?mod=MW_story_quote), where it is overweight for the first time since the COVID-19 crisis. Fundamentals for the dollar [**DXY,** **0.21%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DXY?mod=MW_story_quote) will remain unsupportive over the medium term, which will be another positive for emerging-market equities, the strategists added.

They are buying the dip in gold [**GCZ20,** **-0.81%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/GCZ20?mod=MW_story_quote), with a $2,200 target, due to the heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, which is “likely to push investors back into alternative cash preservation assets.”

**The buzz**

Seemingly dead, there is again the talk of a new U.S. stimulus package, after House Democrats [have started drafting a new stimulus bill](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/house-democrats-prep-new-bill-as-gambit-to-get-stimulus-efforts-unstuck-11600986302) worth $2.4 trillion, down from $3 trillion previously. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said “we’ll be hopefully soon at the table with them,” while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the two sides have agreed to continue talks.

As I lay down I imagine what today can be if I pick the right lottery ticket. I think about TSLA, AAPL and GOOG.

As I fall asleep, papa Elon blesses me with a dream. Here it goes:

Im sitting at my PC looking at TSLA ticker, ready to buy in near open. I don’t remember why but i was ready to speedrun this shit.

The markets open. TSLA is steady at 300 but then...catastrophe. The stock price goes in less than 3 seconds to $5!

I see it and know “THIS IS MY CHANCE”. I buy but before my order gets processed, I bought in at $180.

“Well fuck”, I think to myself. But then I look...and the stock keeps rising.... 200....250....300....420....480!!!

Jackpot... as I want to pat myself on the back, the screeching voice of my mother wakes me up “why are you still sleeping at 10AM, wake up” she says as she opens the blinds.

My sweat covered ass and cum covered sheets become visible. The dream was too good.

She looks at me in disgust and leaves.

Open PC, see TSLA futes still on the rise. Check account...still negative AT...

69,How can we make gay bears into straight bulls?,7783597757,1601031048,"So, I've been thinking for several days now. I never understood why stonks go down.

Then I came to a realisation that stonks go down because gay bears sell the stonks and then demand for these very same stonks decreases which in turn makes stonks go down.

So how do we approach this problem? We need to make gay bears stop selling.

To solve this problem, we first need to understand why gay bears are selling stonks.

The main reasons I see here:

1. They are gay and bears, duh. That's an obvious one
2. They think stonks are ""too high"" or ""overvalued""

The solutions: 

1. We need to convert them from gay to straight. If you've seen clockwork orange then you'd know there's a method that should work for this. We have to show them gay images and during this time we need to induce feelings of total sickness. We need to post gay images in other investing subreddits which gay bears are often visiting, for instance r/investing and others, this must be accompanied with other images or sounds that make them feel sick. I believe if we group together we can do it.
2. First of all, obviously there is no such thing as ""too high"". Have you ever seen a heroin addict say that ""oh no I am too high"". Also it's a self fulfilling prophecy. Stonks are only too high because they might fall in the future. If gay bears realised the only reason they might fall is because they are gay bears, I'm sure we could convince them to never sell. Give heroin to gay bears and see if they still think there exists ""too high"". If anything they want to be high again.

79,The paradox of Tesla,-random--user-,1600986870,"Recently I decided to get in on the stock game and invest some hard earned cash in companies like Tesla and Cubic. Unfortunately, battery day was a bust and investors didn’t see the value of the new technology in production. I took this short-term loss to heart and decided to start learning more about the stock market and strategies! 

I started reading “stock investing for dummies” (yeah, I know) and came across some interesting points of knowledge. In one of the chapters on “investment styles”, the author talks about conservative investing vs. aggressive investing. He basically says:

Conservative:
-high cap businesses
-leaders of industry
-staying power

And 

Aggressive:
-great potential
-capital gain possibility
-innovation 

This makes Tesla such an interesting investment option because it fulfills requirements for both styles. Not only is it a safe, large company that is leading the industry, but has shown great growth potential and innovation in the past year. It has the possibility to grow slowly over time OR explode 400% in the course of only a year.

98,Tesla ($TSLA) claims Nikola ($NKLA) stole its truck design from Rimac designer,germandar,1600985023,"In a surprising turn of events, Tesla (TSLA) now claims Nikola (NKLA) stole its truck design from Rimac’s designer in an update to its patent lawsuit update.

&amp;#x200B;

As we previously reported, Nikola alleged that Tesla’s electric truck design infringes on its existing patents.

Specifically, a series of three design patents that Nikola obtained for the design of a few features of [its Nikola One truck](https://electrek.co/2017/09/20/bosch-electric-powertrain-nikola-motors-semi-truck/) unveiled in 2016 — a year before Tesla unveiled its own electric truck.

Nikola is asking for $2 billion in damages from Tesla.

Tesla denies the claims, but since Nikola obtained the design patent, it is now in a position to either show that it is not infringing on the patent or attempt to invalidate the patents.

In a new response filed this week, Tesla claimed that the patents aren’t valid because Nikola failed to disclose that some of the Nikola One’s features were designed by Adriano Mudri, most known for being the Director of Design at Rimac.

Tesla wrote in their response:

&gt;“Adriano Mudri is the designer of the Road Runner concept truck. The Road Runner truck is a hydrogen-powered concept truck. The Road Runner concept truck was entered into the 2010 Michelin Design Challenge, and was selected for display at the 2010 North American International Auto Show. Several images of the Road Runner concept truck are reproduced below.”

0,Investing in the 2020 Election,pdwp90,1600984864,"**Motivation**

Sites like PredictIt give you the ability to directly bet on 2020 election outcomes, but have unfavorable fee structures and restrictive limits on how much money you can put in. I wanted to take a quantitative approach in determining which stocks to buy based on my 2020 election predictions.

**Background**

I define ""Trump Beta"" as the correlation between a stock's daily prices changes and the daily changes in Trump’s election odds. Presidential election odds are calculated based off of trading on the PredictIt betting market, where over 100,000 users are buying and selling contracts on the outcome of this next election.

I’ve been scraping the PredictIt website every day since June 2019, to get a complete picture of how each candidate's election odds have evolved over time.

Of course, both stock market prices and PredictIt election odds are noisy numbers, and correlation does not necessarily indicate causation. However, I believe that political beta is still a powerful tool for quantifying the potential stock market impact of different election outcomes.

**Results**

I calculated the Trump Beta for &gt;5,000 publicly traded companies. I built a full dashboard from my results, which you can find down in the comments (mods willing). Below are insights into some of the industries whose performance I found to be highly correlated with the outcome of the election.

&amp;#x200B;

**Health Technology and Health Services**

Most companies in both the health technology and the health services sectors have had a high positive correlation with a Trump re-election.

The effect of the election on health technology and health services stocks will likely depend not only on who wins the Presidency but also on whether or not Republicans maintain control of the Senate.

If Democrats win both the White House and the Senate (and maintain control of the House) you’ll see revived efforts to pick up the pieces of the Affordable Care Act and continue to transform the U.S. healthcare system. This transformation is likely to come at the expense of private healthcare companies' bottom lines.

On the other hand, Republicans maintaining control of the White House and/or Senate would likely result in a divided government, with no significant legislation on healthcare being passed.

**Cannabis**

Not surprisingly, most major cannabis stocks have a very low Trump Beta, meaning I think they are more likely to perform well if Biden is elected.

Canopy Growth Corp ($CGC) has a Trump Beta of -0.20, GW Pharmaceuticals ($GWPH) comes in at -0.29, and Cronos Group ($CRON) has a Trump Beta of -0.31.

Though Biden took a tough stance on federally controlled substances back in the 1980s and 1990s, he has recently embraced a platform of decriminalizing marijuana. Additionally, running mate Kamala Harris is known as an advocate for legalization. As a junior senator in California, she sponsored the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, which the Democrat-controlled House Judiciary Committee passed last November. The bill hasn’t gotten anywhere yet, but many suppose that a democratic sweep this November could lead to marijuana legalization.

On the other hand, cannabis legislation has not been a priority under Trump, and there is no reason right now to believe that this will change during a second term.

**Large-cap Tech Companies**

Companies in the technology services and electronic technology sectors have an average Trump Beta of 0.12 and 0.15, respectively. This is primarily driven by the large-cap tech companies that dominate their industries, with Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Adobe all showing strong positive correlations with a Trump re-election.

Despite having been part of the tech-friendly Obama administration, Biden is expected to support stricter antitrust oversight of tech companies, which could pose a major threat to tech giants such as Google and Amazon.

Trump’s current regulatory scrutiny around tech companies centers around allegations of anti-conservative bias (free speech concerns) and attempts to block Chinese-owned companies (TikTok, WeChat). Despite antitrust investigations into Google and Facebook during Trump's 1st term, there has been little serious action taken so far against major tech companies.

Big Tech has enjoyed record business success so far during Trump’s presidency. Under Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), passed in December 2017, taxes on cash repatriated from overseas were lowered, allowing tech executives to bring back hundreds of billions of dollars which were passed on to shareholders via buybacks. At the same time, the reduction on the corporate tax rate, from 35% to 21%, gave tech companies a serious boost to earnings.

&amp;#x200B;

1,how i view the market in terms of SPY at this point,jkwonnnn,1600984861,"Hello WSB, here goes my first post

2020 March was the market crash, and it was completely reasonable. Unemployment skyrocketed, consumer spending decreased, and therefore people needed cash. As a result, people took money out of market, cry.pto currencies, banks, and even selling gold, etc. No people, unless you are 90 years old, were accustomed to the new environment. People started changing their lifestyles in general, such as working remotely, opening up brokerage account, staying inside the shelter, etc.

The market recovered fast however. We had statistics of decreasing unemployments, first stimulus bill, unemployment claim until July, etc. As a result, more people had access to money, especially the low classes. It's also completely reasonable why tech stocks flew the most. Public places were closed = decreasing revenue from retail stores / entertainments / flights / hotel/ you name it. And because people stay home more often, people start using in housing products...and well, technology has the easiest access for shopping, so the cash goes from in person places to tech sectors. As a result, tech carried the rest of the market.

But with many more new traders, we created an intense volatility, and yes, the market **did come back up too quick.** The difference between 2008 market crash and now is that we have way more retail traders, and access to trade is so much easier. So the volume = UP So yes, SPY 350 was overextended, and we knew that one day we will have a pullback phase. And thanks to SoftBank loading off billions, market started falling for 3 weeks in a row.

But SPY really should retest February high. Unemployment continues to decrease, places are opening up, and we even have Lost Wage Assistance where we receive 300 dollars per week for people who are still claiming the unemployment. Yet so many people are focused on that extra 1,200 stimulus bill.

If SPY kept going, assuming there isn't COVID, we'd be at around 400. We are at 320 instead. And well, it makes sense why we aren't at 400. But clearly, we don't belong in 320 either. Why? Because all the unemployed Americans can still claim and receive at least 400 dollars per week....and if they just find a part time job, they can definitely live off as a normal life. Most people no longer fear COVID....the death rate reported is not real, as most deaths were from cancer and not corona. **We are basically back to the normal life with social distancing.**

22,How to CONSISTENTLY Outperform the S&amp;P500 using Theta Gang Strategy. A Comprehensive Guide to Wheeling ETFs.,ContentViolation1488,1600982875,"# Introduction

This will be long, but it will also be concise, and is filled with information. Do yourself a favor and read it thoroughly. Don't complain that I got something wrong if you only skimmed the post.

I've been studying options for years, and have read great books such as OAASI cover to cover. In other words, I know some shit. My goal here is to impart a simple strategy that can significantly outperform a ""buy and hold"" strategy on any major index, both so you can make tendies SAFELY, but also to rub it in the faces of those no-nothing /r/investing types who shun options.

One final note before we begin. I realize you can potentially increase returns on this strategy by utilizing margin to sell naked options and such... but I don't want to advocate a strategy that could blow up retards accounts. What I will advocate here is a 100% cash strategy and has no risk of a margin call.

**This strategy is necessarily no riskier than buying and holding an index fund.**

If you insist on using margin to increase your returns, I would suggest simply using margin to own double the amount of assigned and held stock, in order to sell double the number of covered calls. This is a relatively safe way to increase returns.

# The Wheel: An IMPROVED ""Buy and Hold"" Strategy

Forget credit spreads, diagonal spreads, iron condors, and all that often complicated jazz. The absolute best and simplest theta gang strategy, in my humble opinion, is The Wheel. But I'm going to argue for a very specific version of The Wheel here, and that makes all the difference.

While spreads can be effective, we want to maximize returns by collecting FULL PREMIUM for options, and not hedging like a pussy.

**When you think about The Wheel, I want you to picture an IMPROVED ""buy and hold"" strategy.**

The tried and true advice of most financial advisors out there is to drop cash in something like an index fund and forget about it. While this is good and all, we can clearly do better, by utilizing options. What we are attempting here is to mimic a ""buy and hold"" strategy, while consistently augmenting returns by collecting option premium on top.

The Wheel is a simple concept. You sell cash-secured puts and collect premium. If you ever get assigned, you hold and sell covered calls on the assigned stock. If your stock ever gets called away, you go back to selling puts. Rinse and repeat, ad infinitum.

The question of which options to sell and why gets complicated, and I will go into details below, but for simplicity I am advocating simply sticking to 30-45 DTE \~0.30 delta options on major ETFs.

https://preview.redd.it/vntvxqycv5p51.png?width=1286&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0b92bc6d4ecc345f07f4bf09ca2fd4f3f954f85

# The Basic Concept

You want to get PAID to buy stock at a CHEAP price. You can do that by selling OTM cash-secured puts. And you want to get PAID to sell stock at a HIGH price. You can do that by selling OTM covered calls. When you understand this basic concept, you understand 90% of this strategy.

This will outperform ""buy and hold"" for two reasons: 1) It collects option premium on top of stock appreciation, 2) It reduces the cost basis for potential stock purchases. These factors also ensure reduced volatility compared with ""buy and hold,"" as both premium and reduced entry points offer downside protection from falling assets. This is inherently a long-term strategy; if you are unwilling to hold an ETF long-term through a drop or even a recession, don't waste your time... you WILL lose money.

When I've looked for counter-arguments to The Wheel strategy, the common argument I hear is ""it works until it doesn't."" In other words, these people argue that if you run The Wheel on a stock that drops hard and doesn't recover, you will lose money.

**This argument completely falls apart if you run The Wheel on INDEX ETFs.**

SPY and other major indices have recovered from every crash they have ever experienced. Individual stocks like Enron have not. If we want to mimic a conservative ""buy and hold"" strategy WITH diversification, we will only play major ETFs. This eliminates the major argument against The Wheel entirely, since it achieves instant diversification and will mimic the broader market. If you think the US economy will crash and never recover, you should be buying guns and ammo and not options.

The only REAL argument against The Wheel is that you could potentially lose out on stock appreciation during heavy bull runs. While this is true, we will show below that this argument doesn't hold much weight.

# Calculating Returns

It is relatively simple to calculate potential returns for this strategy, so I will do that now using option prices on SPY as of 9/24/2020. Keep in mind IV is currently high, and so these returns will be inflated relative to a calmer market. Also keep in mind that annualizing returns based on one-month results can get wonky. *This is just an example to get a picture of how things work.*

There are two phases to this strategy: Selling CSP's and selling CC's. We will calculate each separately, using 30 DTE options and ignoring compounding for simplicity.

**CSP Return (Conservative 0.30 delta):**

\[(CSP premium \* 100 shares) / collateral\] \* 12 months = Return

\[($5.30 \* 100) / $31,000\] \* 12 = **20.5% return**

**CSP Return (Aggressive ATM/0.50 delta):**

\[(9.00 \* 100) / $32,000\] \* 12 = **33.7% return**

**CC Return (Conservative 0.30 delta):**

S&amp;P500 return + \[(CC premium \* 100 shares) / collateral\] \* 12 months = Return

S&amp;P500 return + \[($4.12 \* 100) / $32,500\] \* 12 = **S&amp;P return + 15.5%**

Now there are a few caveats for the above calculations. The first is that if the S&amp;P500 rallies well past our CC strike price, we will lose out on those potential gains. This means the CC-side return for the S&amp;P is capped, which can be calculated as follows:

**Maximum CC Return:**

\[(Strike price - stock price) \* 100 shares + (CC premium \* 100 shares)\] / collateral = Return (one month)

\[($334 - $325) \* 100 + ($4.12 \* 100)\] / $32,500 = **4.0% (48% annualized)**

By reversing this we can calculate how much SPY would have to rise to outperform us.

$325 \* 1.04 = $338

In other words, if SPY rises more than $13 in one month it will outperform us, but only for THAT MONTH. Obviously the S&amp;P doesn't achieve 48% returns annually and so bull months will be offset by flat and bear months. We will outperform the S&amp;P in both those categories as shown above, which will more than make up the difference in lost potential gains.

One final note: These calculations assume that all options are held until expiration. In practice, returns can be increased by closing winning positions early. If you achieve 70% gain in 10 days, it makes little sense to wait another 20 days to collect the remaining 30% premium. Simply close and roll as necessary.

# A Guide for Smaller Accounts + Proof of Concept

To run the strategy I am advocating on SPY, you would need a minimum account size of \~$35,000. I know a lot of you don't have that much money, so I've done a little experiment for smaller accounts.

I set aside a fund to run The Wheel on smaller ETFs, such as XLE, XLF, and GDX. To run the wheel on these individually you would need an account size no bigger than \~$4000. Even smaller ETFs such as SILJ could be run for as little as $1500, though they are more risky and less liquid. To prove the concept for smaller accounts, I set aside $10,000 and ran smaller ETFs such as these for 4 months.

**After 4 months, I achieved a 41% annualized return. This outperformed the SPY ETF during the same period by around 5%, despite the fact the ETFs utilized underperformed relative to SPY. This, in my view, provides some proof of concept.**

Obviously this return would have dropped significantly during this recent market drop, which is why I stopped running the strategy on the 18th, to avoid losing my own money just for proof of concept. The best strategy will always be adaptive to market conditions, but if you want a one-size-fits-all approach, The Wheel is probably the best you can get.

In one instance I used margin to purchase an additional 100 shares of SILJ to sell a second CC for ""free"" (minus margin costs), just to offer an example of how margin can be safely used to increase returns. I also sold ATM options on SILJ shares because I wanted to dump it quickly before the crash, and to collect higher premiums. Got very lucky and sold right before the drop on Monday. This is an example of how to adapt the strategy based on your market predictions.

Here is a complete breakdown of my trades during this 4 month period. **Notice that I usually closed positions early in order to increase my $/day return.**

# A Note on Past Wheel Guides

A prominent past guide on running The Wheel argued that you should always avoid assignment. However, they never made a compelling case for WHY you should avoid assignment. There is an argument to be made for such a position, which I will provide soon. However, there are also a number of arguments to be made in favor of accepting or even seeking assignment. They run as follows:

1) Time Premium is maximized when the strike price is ATM. If we are selling time premium (Theta), selling ATM will tend to maximize premium returns long-term.

[Apparently this picture didn't exist on the internet until now...](https://preview.redd.it/16ijbdsgv5p51.jpg?width=4608&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb7fda8a060de84719695afc98c09f8bb7f644f9)

2) If we are bullish on an Index long-term, we shouldn't have any problem accepting stock ownership. In fact, it will likely increase our returns due to stock appreciation on top of option premium.

3) Stock can be more easily owned on margin than options. Holding double the stock on margin and selling twice as many covered-calls will outperform selling cash-secured puts long-term.

These past guides also focused on running The Wheel on individual stocks. I have so far not yet seen a guide advocating The Wheel purely on Index ETFs to mimic and outperform a ""buy and hold"" diversified strategy. **This is perhaps the most important takeaway from this guide.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Maximizing Returns: ATM vs. OTM?**

This strategy is simple enough... Where it gets complicated is in the details. And the most difficult question of all is whether to sell ATM, or OTM, and if so how deep?

Let's start with the absolute ideal scenarios...

**In a bull market: You want to sell ATM puts and OTM calls.**

**In a bear market: You want to sell OTM puts and ATM calls.**

**In a completely flat market: You want to sell ATM puts and ATM calls.**

The reasoning is simple. If the market is rising, you want to maximize premium on your puts by selling ATM. You also want OTM calls so you don't lose out on gains in stock appreciation when the price rises. The ideal depth for OTM calls would be just above the total underlying appreciation (which obviously is difficult to predict in advance).

By the same token, if the market is falling, you want to sell OTM puts for downside protection against assignment, and you want to sell ATM calls to maximize premium.

In a flat market you simply want to maximize premium and have no need for upside or downside protection, and so ATM will perform best.

If you are brilliant and prescient like me, you can navigate these complicated waters and adapt to the market accordingly. If you are a retard, on the other hand, you can't easily predict where the market is headed...

In that case, my advice is the following:

ALWAYS SELL OTM ON BOTH ENDS. This will give you downside protection from drops, and also give you upside protection from rallies. The consequence of this is your premium returns will be reduced relative to someone who strategically sells ATM options, but that is an acceptable loss for a safer and more conservative strategy if you don't know wtf you are doing. **You will still outperform ""buy and hold"" using this strategy, while also achieving reduced volatility.**

Aiming for selling .30 delta, or 70% Prob ITM options, seems conservative enough for me. You can adjust accordingly based on your personal risk tolerance. If you want a more conservative strategy, aim further OTM. If you want more aggressive strategy, aim closer ATM. Keep in mind you MUST be willing to hold stock long-term through a drop to make this strategy viable! If you aren't willing to actually ""buy and hold"" while selling covered calls, look to gamble elsewhere.

# Other Details

The reasoning for selling 30-45 DTE options, which is advocated by TastyTrade among others, is because theta decay for ATM options accelerates around this range. However, this is only true for ATM options, and OTM options theta decay can actually decelerate closer to expiration. It is likely better to go for longer dated OTM options for this reason, though it won't make a huge difference imo. I would suggest keeping things simple and maintaining a habit around this range.

https://preview.redd.it/s3hl0wekv5p51.png?width=586&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68e42cee750063a6932f96c151a8fb779f292467

Some people attempt to run The Wheel by selling short-term weeklies/FDs. These individuals are not really selling theta so much as they are attempting to scalp gamma. While this can work, it is not really the consistent, safe, long-term strategy we are looking for here. It also suffers from the reduced theta decay for OTM options which I stated above. If you want to gamble, you might as well be BUYING the FD's, not SELLING them!

I would usually close my options at 50%+ return and roll forward/up when necessary. This will tend to yield greater $/day returns if the underlying is moving in your direction. For example: If you make 80% return in 10 days, it makes little sense to hold another 20+ days for another 20% premium gain. Simply close the position and collect the secured premium to release collateral for another sell. If the underlying is moving against your direction, you generally want to hold until expiration and collect 100% of the premium, even if that means assignment. **Closing a sold option for a loss will DESTROY the returns of The Wheel! Do not do this!**

Commercial flying is about to recover to 70% of pre covid levels. We’re currently at 70k commercial flights per day. We were at 110k pre covid and 28k during the peak of the virus. We’re currently at 65% of pre covid levels. Source: https://www.flightradar24.com/data/statistics


BA is a solid company. Yeah it fucked up on the 737 max and has some management issues, but it’s a straight up cash cow. In 2019 it made 100B in revenue and had 10B in profit. Yes, I said profit. This isn’t some TSLA Elon pump shit, this company actually makes a shit ton of cash.

It’s a duopoly that isn’t going away. Yeah, you could also buy airbus, but it’s traded OTC in the US so fuck that. BA and airbus are the only 2 companies that will be selling commercial planes.

You might be thinking just buy the airlines instead? Fuck no, they might go bust anytime. BA ain’t going bankrupt and it’s going to trend along side the entire sector. It’s like an index of all the airlines without the bankruptcy.

It’s fucking dirt cheap right now. I’m not just talking about the stock. IV is at 64%, meaning big moves aren’t priced into the options yet. Buying before the IV spike is how you make money on options. If you haven’t learned this during your time on this sub, you should close this tab now and uninstall Robinhood.


But... second wave.... That’s all bullshit. Even if cases spike again, it’s not gonna stop people from flying. Think about why cases spiked in the first place, because people don’t give a fuck. They aren’t gonna suddenly stop going to the beaches, visiting family, or eating out. People are gonna put on a mask and go their merry way. 


Final DD, I took 5 round trip flights in the last month. Every flight I was on was packed. The last 2 flights I booked cause 5x the price of the first one. Demand is there and it’s going to go up. 

This isn’t some pump and dump cause you retards with your $2000 portfolios aren’t gonna make a dent in this stock. But a good hold if you wanna be like GameStop guy and turn 100K into 1M with 2021 calls.

However, GameStop recently had an uptick and you autists are probably wondering why. Well I'll give you my DD written on a shit stained napkin.  


*So* there is this guy called Ryan Cohen. This is the man who founded **Chewy.com** **CHWY** an online dog food retailer. Now right after making his $600 million dollars off of $BECKY moms who don't know where the local PetSmart is. This man randomly decided to buy a large stake of **GME**  and starts spouting about his plans to turn it into the next **Amazon AMZN**.

This is the majority reason GameStop had a large spike.

So the Bulls are dead, the bulls market has ended? I think not. Together we are strong and we hold more power than the boys on Wall St. Always remember when the chips are down the autists have an extra surge of strength. This is commonly referred to as tard strength, this is us.  


Now lets get to the actual fucking **DD** now that the foreplay is over with. **\~\~START HERE IF YOUR ON THE SPECTRUM\~\~**  


**GME** has had a rough time over the last five years, with thousands of brick and mortar stores closing and people realizing that digital is the new storage medium of choice for games. However, this year is different. People are stuck inside due to the pandemic, buying more games online and having them shipped to them, remember Chads don't understand complex digital stores and prefer their CDs.   


US Furry Association founder **Ryan Cohen** has a chance to breath life back into this decrepit soul. The last major console war and sale was in Q4 of 2013. Seven years ago. This console upgrade cycle will be the largest since the Xbox One and PS4 came out. Already most major retailers are struggling to accept preordered and they are flying off the shelves. This is free money for **GME.**  


In 2013 Q3 **GME** had a revenue of $2.11 billion. The following Q4 2013 had a revenue of  $3.68 billion. This trend stays true every year there is a major increase in next gen console sales. In Q3 2020 **GME** had a revenue of  $1.09 billion, with the prior year Q3 2019 being  $ 1.44 billion . This is within the standard deviation of change, and this is during a pandemic! If the trend stays true revenue is poised to be an increase from Q3 to Q4.

Now while this doesn't sound like amazing news and more like autistic general knowledge, that's true. But this combined with the other news may mean something else entirely.   


**Ryan Cohen** has connections with many intuitional investors and has just bought a sizeable controlling portion of **GME**. Now many would wonder why someone would waste money on **GME**, the reason is something most autists on Wall St. look over. **CASH BALANCES.** **GME** is ***RICH*** in cash right now. With the majority of the stock market on massive discount and people looking for jobs their $700 million dollar balance of cash holdings is very enticing. **Cohen** has said he wants to turn **GME** into the next **Amazon AMZN.** With the closing of brick and mortar stores and the huge cash balance this leaves **GME** poised for growth. This combined with recent growth and the upcoming console sales will help push **GME** into being a household name again.

69,GameStop and Dog Food DD,adrianharris,1600978220,"GameStop **GME** has been going downhill for the past several years due to the digital market for video games. No longer am I forced to bring my fifty discs back to my local GameStop and have them offer me a used bedpan and a spit in the face. Now I can just buy the game online and download it without having to deal with the 400lb McLady neckbeard who works at GameStop during the day and WSB moderates at night.  


However, GameStop recently had an uptick and you autists are probably wondering why. Well I'll give you my DD written on a shit stained napkin.

&amp;#x200B;

*So* there is this guy called Ryan Cohen. This is the man who founded **Chewy.com** **CHWY** an online dog food retailer. Now right after making his $600 million dollars off of $BECKY moms who don't know where the local PetSmart is. This man randomly decided to buy a large stake of **GME**  and starts spouting about his plans to turn it into the next **Amazon AMZN**. ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000699/rc13da2-091820.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000699/rc13da2-091820.htm))

([https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/22/gamestop-rises-sharply-on-disclosure-of-talks-with/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/22/gamestop-rises-sharply-on-disclosure-of-talks-with/))

([https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-stock-price-chewy-investor-plans-amazon-rival-ecommerce-2020-9](https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-stock-price-chewy-investor-plans-amazon-rival-ecommerce-2020-9))

This is the majority reason GameStop had a large spike.

&amp;#x200B;

Now lets get to the actual fucking **DD** now that the foreplay is over with. **\~\~START HERE IF YOUR ON THE SPECTRUM\~\~**

The last major console upgrade was in Q4 of 2013. This was the Xbox One and PS4 console war, very similar to the console battle going on currently. In this year there was a similar uptick around September, followed by downward movement prior to October/November. 

&amp;#x200B;

[GME 2013](https://preview.redd.it/i3z24va5g5p51.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c47f7495505707e91e9bdc0882957dc5132dc0)

During this Q4 2013 **GME** had a reported revenue of  3.68 billion. With a prior Q3 2013 revenue of  2.11  Billion. This was a 18.8% increase to the prior year, with no new consoles announced. Now in comparison we have this year Q3 2020 slated with $1.09 billion in revenue. While there are many causations for this decrease in revenue some of the main include: old infrastructure, dying market share, and sweaty neckbeards dying off due to Covid. The greatest reason is due to the pandemic closing down their in person stores, their bread and butter.

**Now** **GME** has had a rough go over the last five years. Closing thousands of brick and mortar stores. Now this looks awful to any investor, and even you autists have probably stayed away from it. *However*, there is a bonus to closing all these stores. **GME** has become ***Cash Rich***. **GME** has over $700 *million* in cash holdings. ([https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/12/gamestop-is-cash-rich-but-growth-poor/#:\~:text=Financial%20wins&amp;text=GameStop%20counts%20over%20%24700%20million,above%20its%20current%20market%20capitalization](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/12/gamestop-is-cash-rich-but-growth-poor/#:~:text=Financial%20wins&amp;text=GameStop%20counts%20over%20%24700%20million,above%20its%20current%20market%20capitalization).).

  
In addition to this $700 million in cash holdings past trends of **GME** revenue during console war years show the company is essentially given free money by Xbox and PlayStation. People have to buy their refrigerators and routers from someone and since all the major retailers have been selling out so quick in preorders that their sites have been struggling to keep up. ([https://www.tomshardware.com/news/xbox-series-x-name-confusion-amazon](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/xbox-series-x-name-confusion-amazon)). It's going to be a green quarter for **GME**. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now then this combined **Ryan Cohen** (remember him? the furry guy) taking a large interest in **GME** can spell for a revival of the household classic game company. With the amount of funds that Cohen can bring in with investors and the amount of cash rich holdings **GME** already has, and the decreasing amount of brick and mortar sales. This leaves **GME** poised to become a competitor to **Amazon** **AMZN** and other online game market places. With the amount of money and know how under Cohen's management I can see an update to the **GME** web store coming in the future and a change in their business model, moving more towards competing with other online retailers and completely dissolving their physical properties. With the upcoming console sales they will see a rise in revenue and stock valuation and this combined with the other news has a good chance of pushing **GME** back into the online retailer space.  


**TLDR: GameStop is going to turn into a dog food retailer and turn physical locations into Pet Salons. Also the stock will rocket to the moon because console sales will make the neckbeards and chads come together.**

76,Max Put Value?,sprrrtrns,1600977588,"Good afternoon WSB, I have a retarded question that will get me flamed to the high heavens.

Can the value of a put go above its max profit? Say you buy a put with a strike of $10 a couple months out on a low vol stock for a total of $1 to keep the math easy. Your max profit at exercise is if it goes to zero: (100 shares * $10 - $0) - ($1 * $100) = $900.

Now let’s say that the company makes a revolutionary blender that it’s taken tons of pre orders for, the only revenue is from the chief engineer installing wiring in the CEO’s house, and it comes out that they had a guy sitting under the table with a hand crank during the product demo videos, and the volatility of the underlying spikes substantially. Obviously the max payment at expiry is capped at $1000, but holding all the other Greeks constant, can the value of the option ever rise above the max intrinsic value of $1000 before expiry? Or will implied volatility essentially have a cap that prevents the option value from rising beyond intrinsic value, no matter how volatility of the underlying rises? It seems as though if it can rise above the max intrinsic value, that it’s an arbitrage opportunity- you sell the put for say $12, collect $1,200 total and sit on it. If the volatility is that high, it may come back and get exercised in theory but your max loss is $10 a share so you’re guaranteed profits. But implied volatility essentially having a cap also seems like an inefficiency that would introduce arbitrage opportunities I don’t have the education or skill set at this point in my life to recognize.

I should know this as I work in finance, have a couple licenses, mid CFA, etc, but I have barely worked with options, plus I am an autist and need someone slightly less autistic than me to explain.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz4k51/max_put_value/

I didn't know what to do at first but have now decided that investing in the stock market would be the best decision. 

Since, I know absolutely nothing about the stock market, I want to use this opportunity to learn a skill while being responsible with this money.

Let me guess, while stalking ""the one that got away"" on Insta, a ""finance guru"" pops up in your feed and paints the road to tendie-land via options trading. In your free student checking account, you have a whopping $500 your grandma left you. Or your wife's boyfriend just increased your allowance and you feel the need to show him up by making tendies. You put two and two together and decide to dabble making your way to r/wallstreetbets. 

Legitimizing your place in the spectrum, you gallantly decide to begin trading but have no idea where to even begin. As all the rash decisions that precede you, your first post sounds similar to ""how do I make money on options"", ""I want to learn but don’t know where to begin"", ""what brokerage should I use"", etc. which immediately puts you on the road to getting banned!

Little did you know that many of these questions can be answered by referring to the [FAQ section](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/faq). Please make use of it as you begin your journey to tendie land and best of luck!

Wait for the short squeeze to happen soon, 50$ is highly probable. 

For those of you retards who don't know what short squeeze means: normally if you want to short a stock you borrow it (for a fee) and sell to buy back at lower price and make bank. But what happens if the price goes up against you? You not only have to pay the borrow fee as time passes, you also can get margin called and have to buy back the shares at higher prices. Which drives price higher. Which makes more shorters be margin called and buy back shared. Rinse and repeat and watch the price fly to the fucking moon

I believe this is the last change to hop in on the dip. GME is down today to sub-10 levels, but is rising back again as I write it so anyone who wants a golden ticket to the fucking moon - come on in.

NCLH $17 Calls are \~$0.50 right now, which is surprising given that NCLH traded up to $17 one week ago. NCLH / RCL executives spoke on CNN on Tuesday, and already released a lot of the bad news into the market (cumulative 2021 bookings still below 2020 but not as dramatically as some investors may think), so a big sell-off wont happen without a SPY crash. 

If you're trying to play a bull market 7-14 day run, I think these calls are the way to go since cruise trades in-line with market sentiment / corona fears. If NCLH goes up 10% next week, these calls could easily 5x. I'd advise hedging slightly with OOM near-dated SPY puts (or just initiating a smaller NCLH position).

5,Tech will rise this winter.,qdolobp,1600966769,"My guess is that Tech stocks will continue a slow decline for the next month or so. But come flu season I think we are going to see another quick spike. Get ready, because that’s when you’ll want to sell off. Here’s why I think this is the case. 

Tech was inflated due to COVID. It’s kinda dying off some and people are selling for profits. Let it drop. Save up some side cash. Come December/January we’ll be in the midst of flu season. Why is this important? Because COVID and the flu have similar symptoms. Normally, 80% of the US population doesn’t even know if they have COVID when they are infected, so they don’t care. When flu season hits though, people will be getting sick with the flu, thinking it’s COVID, and freak out. We’ll see a huge rise in demand for tests and an inevitable lockdown and or major restrictions on social interaction. 

I’ll give you an example. Johnny is 25. If he got COVID right now he probably wouldn’t even know. But when Johnny gets the flu he’ll know for sure he’s sick. Testing might not be available, so he has to assume it’s COVID and stay inside. He has to quarantine, and anyone around him will need to as well. Same applies for actual COVID. So basically imagine the rules we have for COVID, only it’s applied to the flu too. 

The rest is common sense I feel. Tech stocks will be down in price, people will be locked up, and opportunities will be present. This is when you buy in to tech stocks. March 2.0 baby. And right when flu season is coming to an end, sell that shit like you sell your TSLA stocks on battery day.

10,RAD (Rite Aid),thatssofaraway,1600966137," 

Rite Aid (RAD) **fell 15% after good second quarter sales and earnings.**

Revenues **increased 11.5%**, driven by more pharmaceutical **demand. This demand will increase** as covid cases increase in the fall/winter, and as it continues to expand it's COVID-19 testing sites.

They have 303 testing sites across **15 states,** and this number is **growing,** with **39 additional locations opening this Friday** in California, Oregon, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia. They have a nice partnership with the HSS (US Department of Health and Human Services).

They do testing using simple self-swab nasal tests that are overseen by Rite Aid pharmacists.

Adjusted EBITDA is **up 13%**. They're in a net loss, but it just got **reduced by 80%**, and they're expecting a **upward trend** in positive net profts.

Like I said, this is because of the upcoming flu season, as well as new covid testing locations open as covid cases rise.

this company isn't the best as of now, but clearly this downwards trend is reversing. Additionally, **falling 15%** on s**tronger than expected earnings** that came out of nowhere **is pretty gay,** and **will** see **a reversal,** which we are already seeing within the company's output.

TL:DR: fell 15% on STRONG earnings. Expecting upwards trend of company revenue and profits. Monthly calls should print. Should be pretty RAD. Can't go tits up.

52,CarMax (KMX) is a great buy,Vad23789,1600962502,"CarMax just released quarterly earnings of $1.79 per share, beating expectations by around 45%. the stock is currently down 13% to about $92. lemme present the case for buying CarMax. Position: 80 shares but planning to add more on a bigger dip. 

CarMax is the biggest used car dealer in the nation. They outperform all competition when it comes to net income for the past year. speaking of competition, their largest competitor is Auto Nation. Auto Nation sells both new and used cars and also has business in auctions. CarMax focusses primarily on the used car industry and is much more recognizable. A quick google trends search shows that CarMax is superior in search popularity. Carvana is a similar company, but also trails in search popularity. Carvana is also operating at a net loss of $62 mil , CarMax had net income of $888 mil last year. So now that we know CarMax is the best in the used car industry, lets take a dive further into the company.

CarMax's is very profitable. Sales have grown by about 12% since 2017, while net income has grown around 42% in the same time. their presence in the US is also increasing, adding 13 new stores in the past year for a total of 216 (from last 10-k, website shows 245 locations). along with the increase in locations, same store sales are also up to 9.7% in FY 2020 which is impressive. I'll attach a factsheet with a summary of this important info and more things that are relevant.

Used car sales are rising, propelled by corona, and CarMax is in the perfect position to capitalize on it. Used car prices were up an average of 4.0% in August 2020 compared to August 2019, and as demand for used cars rises, we could see used car prices rise with it. This is a double-edged sword for CarMax, but should over all benefit the companies bottom line. A big thing to take into account is CarMax's omni channel platform, which they announced yesterday is in full effect. this omni channel platform allows customers to buy used cars fully online and have them delivered to their houses. This is a huge convenience and CarMax is setting a new standard when it comes to used car sales and distribution. This also allows customers to have access to CarMax's full inventory which is another huge plus. Not that is matters but most analysts have KMX as a buy right now as well.

92,Storytime with u/StudentLoanBets,StudentLoanBets,1600960092,"Dear autists of [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/),

It is with much sorrow that I write this, my final memoir. I'd like to say it's been real, and it's been fun, but it hasn't, and my journey here has come to an end.

A year ago I had a decent paying job, a loving girlfriend, and about $90,000 in student loans from earning my Bachelor's in Chemical Engineering.

I lost my job right before the pandemic, which made it difficult to find work for a while and I decided I was going to day trade and start my own business instead of running back to another engineering job, looking back, this was obviously a big mistake.

Today, I have $200 in my bank account, $1900 in garbage options sitting in Robinhood, $21,000 in CC debt, and still $90,000 in student loans. I even lost my girlfriend of 7+ years (for various reasons, but my Robinhood problem certainly didn't help).

I've been applying for jobs but rarely hear back on my applications, which is wearing this last thread of hope thin. I have no idea how I'm going to get out of this personal hell I've created, but I don't think I'm going to find the answer here, so this is my farewell.

If you've been following along, there's only one thing I've gained in my time on this subreddit, [a tattoo of the logo on my butt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/io8i5z/im_back_bitches/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and the story behind it is somewhat interesting, so here goes.

On 7/26/20 I [posted a bet](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hygc5c/if_spy_closes_green_tomorrow_ill_get_a_tattoo_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) here saying that if SPY closed green on Monday 7/27 I'd get a tattoo of the logo and sure enough, SPY was green just as it had been every damn Monday of the summer.

I always intended to follow up, and it was shocking to me recently seeing how many tattoo (and other) bets have been posted on here and not followed up on. I have too much respect for this community of morons to post anything without backing it up.

Following the bet, my account took a dive and I couldn't scrape together even a measly $300 for the tattoo until a few weeks later. I was given 2-3 month wait times from the shops I got quoted on, and had been banned from the subreddit so I couldn't explain myself.

On 8/24 Robinhood sold off every option in my account to the lowest bidder, stating it was for a Reg T call that was due to be resolved by that Thursday, 8/27. I am going to do what I can legally to recoup some of these losses, but I don't know where to start and any time not spent applying to jobs now just gives me more crippling anxiety.

Finally, on 9/2/20 I was fed up with it all, I took a chance and called an old friend I hadn't talked to in years to see if she'd tattoo my butt. I was dreading this enough before adding the embarrassment of having it done by a close friend, but I had a debt to pay and had no more fucks to give after being berated by my parents earlier that week for just the suggestion that I needed help with money. The artist told me she'd make time for me whenever I wanted, so I made plans for that weekend and drove 5 hours across the state to her shop that weekend.

[Texted almost exactly at the top](https://imgur.com/a/S1lIesK)

I told her some of the story behind the tattoo before getting there, and she told me she'd be doing it as a favor (I didn't want her pity, so we settled on me buying dinners and drinks over the weekend while we caught up). I wanted to include this because she's an amazing friend, and I really needed that, anything you guys can do to support her (go get a tattoo, buy some art) would be greatly appreciated.

[Photo op](https://imgur.com/a/aHFEbvr)

Since then, I've lost the little bit of hope I had left for my Robinhood account, with the last contracts that could have saved me expiring on 9/18, while the market has tanked. The exact day and hour that I texted Katie to see if she'd do my tattoo, SPY was at it's ATH and has not come close to recovering those losses since.

[Here's my loss porn, enjoy.](https://imgur.com/gallery/4IkbA2l)

I set up a GoFundMe that I never shared out of shame, but if you have an open position for an engineer (I'm smarter than this post makes me sound) please message me about that instead.

If you need me, I'll be living in my car somewhere around Buffalo, NY.

72,NKLA: More Room To Roll,WowKay100,1600954072,"tl;dr Hold your NKLA puts, buy more expiring 2weeks out or more.

Since my previous big NKLA post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/itjdnk/nkla\_is\_finished/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/itjdnk/nkla_is_finished/) the stock dropped from a high of $34 to around $18. Many people made a fuckload of tendies, but now would be a stupid time to take profits. The cliff is insight, and the truck is in motion, let's watch it roll.

Here's why NKLA will trade sub $15 EoW. 

1. BP pull out of Hydrogen infrastructure deal with NKLA. [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/23/nikola-stock-closed-down-xx-after-bp-backs-away-fr/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/23/nikola-stock-closed-down-xx-after-bp-backs-away-fr/) The reason for pulling out is the Hindenburg report and all the controversy since then. This is absolutely critical to NKLA and I can not state this enough. NKLA was never meant to make much profit from it's vehicles, they have said time and time again, the money is from selling hydrogen. This is a huge setback that has completely annihilated the NKLA bussiness model. Source: Jeff Ubben, NKLA Director and early investor in NKLA [https://www.ft.com/content/e5aeb036-fc1a-49d2-970e-63b4879f1973](https://www.ft.com/content/e5aeb036-fc1a-49d2-970e-63b4879f1973) "" We are not trying to sell trucks, we are trying to sell hydrogen ""
2. This is my own speculation: GM will pull out of the NKLA deal. There are no downsides to the deal for GM yes you're right. But there are similarities to the BP deal. NKLA was going to pay BP to build a hydrogen infrastructure, no downsides to BP but they still pulled out because of everything since the report. NKLA will not have 700mill to pay upfront to GM for the manufacturing line, 11% of NKLA stock is going to be worth less than 100mill when they start selling it. On top of that, everyone is cancelling their Badger pre-orders, so 80% BEV credits on 0 trucks is 0 profit. I expect GM to announce they are out by EoW or next week.
3. NKLA futher downgraded: [https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-nkla-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2020-09/](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-nkla-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2020-09/) $15 price target. This is the start of more downgrades in my opinion.
4. On 3rd December, all the initial investors from the VectoIQ merger such as IVECO will be eligible to sell their shares. This is a huge dilution that is imminent
5. Ongoing SEC/DoJ investigation as well as lawsuits coming NKLAs way
6. Q3 earnings will be a disaster if they even make it that far. Cash on hand was 600mill, that's the only thing this company has going for them. 

Overally NKLA is the same stock it was before it went public and after it went public at $10. The only difference now is there is too much downward momentum with no positive catalysts in sight. NKLA world will most likely be cancelled. This company will go bankrupt or delisted, it's a race to see which happens first.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iyx8wf/nkla_more_room_to_roll/

Wouldn’t it be ideal to buy Tesla calls then exercise them as Tesla fans start pumping up the stock then sell immediately to make a profit or hold for the long term. 

It seems like Tesla stock has increased 1000% in 12 months. Yes I know people say it’s based ok growth not earnings etc but still. I support both Elon Musk and Tesla but sometimes both baffle me. For instance, I wouldn’t be surprised if Elon Musk posted on twitter that he was taken a shower and all of a sudden Tesla’s valuation increases by like $20B. 

It’s crazy how billions of dollars paper value is added so easily and can be traded for dollars. It’s like the modern day stock market is a Ponzi scheme. Investors making other investors money. Lol and people thought Bernie Madoff’s was the biggest.

CALLS DEO

&amp;#x200B;

As much of the west coast continues to burn, smoke (which we've seen out on the East Coast) is beginning to descend onto Napa Valley. This smoke and ash is changing the chemical compounds of grapes causing them to release too many phenols which can sour (no pun intended) grapes. One taster compared smokey wine to [""fecal plastic""](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-wildfires-oregon-fires-wineries-ecead6f181c11c6110f017c9af8e63a2). How this motherfucker knows what plastic shit, or shit served in plastic is a story for another time (obviously he was so impressed with 2 girls one cup that he tried it). 

Anyways, 2020 looks to be a wash for the American producers as they refuse to accept grapes unless tested in a Lab. Said Lab is already backed up for the rest of the year. So Puts on STZ (Constellation Brands, produce in Napa and Sonoma County). WVVI (Willamette Valley Vineyards, located in Oregon, probably same smoky issues). Calls on DEO (Diageo in bed with Moet). If you have access to European markets, there are better options with the French producers ( LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton)

Looks like this dumpster fire of a year is fucking with the Hobos nutrition.

&amp;#x200B;

Hill-rom (HRC) does hospital bed rentals and operating room equipment. Every hospital's capacity is at its peak and you guessed it, higher demand for hospital beds. It's trading at a discount now, just slightly above the crash in March and literally can't go tits up.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for the recent dip is because of the general negative market sentiments and the downplaying of HRC's revenue guidance in its previous earnings -- In its latest 10-Q (July 31) it says that the growth in demand for their products due to corona is offset by project delays in hospitals and clinics. If the pandemic improves, hospitals will resume normal activities and this would mean higher demand for operations. On the contrary, if it worsens, hospitals will get hospital beds. Either way, HRC benefits.

&amp;#x200B;

All other hospital stocks are trading way higher than their March lows... compared to HRC.. Clearly, this share is trading at a discount.

&amp;#x200B;

HRC has been ranging between 82\~84 for slightly more than a week now and the tutes have been accumulating more shares. This will hit $100 easily (25% upside) and that's not even at the peak of its pre-corona of $115.

48,(DDDD) - Cure Market-Induced PTSD with Bill Ackman's PSTH,ryan148h,1600942122,"Okay cunts, welcome to Dad-Driven-Due-Diligence.  
As you know theres probably thousands of fellow waterheads that got absolutely booty-punctured by TSLA this Week.  
But from destruction comes creation.

While we all have PTSD from the last few days of bloody Robinhood screenshots, I present to you the golden gicket to cure that PTSD: 

# Pershing Square Tontine Holdings aka. PSTH

Jesus Fuck that was cringey but anyways; 

I asked my Dad what his most speculative Investment was and he told me about PSTH.   
Suprised that he didn't own some Boomer Shit like Nikola or Zoom i asked him about it and he explained what it was.    
PSTH is the largest SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) to date. This Company was sponsored by Pershing Square Capital Management. It's CEO is Bill Ackman and he will be looking to acquire a minority stake in a Company to grow. 

If you don't know what a SPAC is, it's basically a way to take a company public without doing a traditional IPO. 

Examples of companies that were taken public by way of a SPAC: 

Hyliion   
Nikola   
Virgin   
Galactic   
DraftKings   
and More  

The difference between most SPAC's and PSTH is, that the sponsors of PSTH only get paid after a deal is made and a minimum return of 20% is made. This is way more investor-friendly than most SPAC's. Bill Ackman also has a lot riding on this SPAC. His Activist-Investing record is something like 30-2-1, meaning he has been successful or neutral on all Plays except his JC-Penny Restructuring Play.

Possible Mergers at the moment:  

Stripe, Bloomberg, Wish, Waymo, Mars  

My Strategy is a ton of Shares as well as March 2021 Leaps, because this shit is going to Moon.

The melt down at the NKLA sub has been wild for the last week with them banning literally everyone hah

2. Fed has announced unlimited QE earlier this year.

Summary
1 + 2 above = market won't tank too hard for too long as it already anticipates further QE,  or market tanks a bit harder before QE is announced in which markets recover.

http://imgur.com/gallery/r2KvWGd

Tl;dr: I'm down 80% on a yolo because I don't understand people, so this seems like a good reason to double down.

So in July I [predicted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hnvdid/10k_beerflu_ending_yolo/) that people in most of the US would quickly stop giving a shit about beerflu, cough all over each other, and get over it minus a few boomers. Cases at the time were spiking and everyone was losing their minds. I got $10,000 worth of SPG calls (a mall REIT) for $70 stike and 10/16/20 expiration, expecting the forward-looking market to price it back above $100 within a few weeks, giving myself a few months just in case. I thought about buying puts on ZM at $200, at $250, at $300, then realized that if something is already insane it's probably not going to suddenly stop. Holy fuck ZM's valuation is retarded. I should buy the puts I was looking at two months ago, now they only cost $1 each and it's not like they can even go down any more. Guaranteed tendies.

Anyway, fast forward two and a half months and I was right, except for the part about the markets being forward-looking. US cases finished spiking, then have been in steady decline despite everyone except a few places saying ""yolo"" and reopening basically everything. Trust me I live in upstate NY and there are stores with signs asking people (illegally) to take their masks off, we didn't win by being smart we won by getting enough people sick already. Deaths trended lower even more. Florida, which declared they are reopening even if it kills every old fuck coughing on the steps of their trailer home, has seen a steady drop in cases while doing that. For a while though SPG just kind of moved violently in a tight band with slightly higher lows and I became resigned to selling a few OTM monthlys as a diagonal to squeeze money out of dumber retards than me and eventually only expecting to break even or make a small profit. It ends up at $74 a week ago.

Then Europe relaxed their super strict lockdowns that were making them look better than us and surprisedpikachuface they get exponentially more cases in the last week. Instead of accepting their fate they decide to close their economy again, and for some reason this gives US markets a stroke. So SPG is at $62 and my calls that were slightly up last week are now down 80%.

Clearly I am still right so today I sold some DKNG and doubled my SPG position so I could be twice as right. Tomorrow if it goes down more I might sell some more stuff so I can triple my position and be even more right. Fuck this virus and all the retards selling value stocks to buy rebranded fucking skype.

1,"Any advice on what to do? I lost $317 in TSLA stock for buying in the ""Battery day"" event",Neoar2000,1600912494," Hey guys.... today and yesterday were awful days for me, I'm depressed as fuck because I basically bought into the hype and bought 4 shares of TSLA stock ($2k) when it was rising in price.

I was feeling great and happy, because the price raised to the point it even made me $20 in profit. And I even took the time to tell my mother about my success, but all of that died down as I saw the stock fall terribly until it reached in the aftermarket hours to $395, I was hitting myself up for the loss.  
And then today in the morning, I saw the stock price go up to $410 (I initially bought these shares at $437), so it wasn't that big of a loss, and I thought there was a light in the tunnel, so I decided to wait.... aaaand at the moment I'm writing this, the stock price is $367. And with that, my market value is now $1667.22, when I started with $2k.

Now the thing is, my subconscious was telling me to sell, 2 times between yesterday and today. But I never did paid attention to that, and I lost more than I wanted.

The bad thing about this? This is basically 66% of my entire savings from 6 months of money I was lucky to make during the pandemic.

I'm so stupid for not doing things right.... and I don't know if I should hold the shares until the price goes back up slowly? Or just sell everything and recoup my entire investment, minus the current loss.

Any advice on what should I do guys?

82,"Buy NKLA , save a life.($25,462)",CCLyolo,1600907928,"Hello!

Today I thought it would be a good idea to sell naked NKLA puts striking at 26.5, 24, 21.5, 20, 18.5, 17.5$ expiring this Friday. 

Unfortunately those puts are very very leveraged. I am currently at a paper loss of  25,462$ on the day. ( [proof](http://imgur.com/gallery/WPXLGMi) )

I also had to sell all my profitible positions to get room for the margin calls.  In spite of this I ended up getting liqidated on a bunch of OTM puts that spiked in value..

I'm now quite literally shitting myself as if NKLA ends up opening significantly down tomorrow morning I'll likely end up owing my broker more money than the total balance in my account. 

If NKLA holds 21.5 through to the end of the week I'll at least be broke even on the month. If it drops and I get liqidated more then I could end up losing MUCH more than just 25,464$ and I won't be able to make it back.

Please consider closing your shorts and selling your puts tomorrow or even buying a few NKLA shares so my life can continue as normal without the ensuing divorce, homelessness etc..etc.. that will happen if it falls sub 21.5$~

Thank you for your time and consideration!

97,Day 1 of broke,boihand_jpg,1600905103,"Tried trading today. I took out $500 from my college payment and put it in my Robinhood account.

I put it in stocks because I read halfway through the options page on Investopedia, got confused then bored and had to jerk off. Can’t be much harder than buy low sell high.

Analyzing trends is also gay so I just bought the dip in whatever was the biggest movers from yesterday. 

I made like five bucks throughout the day, was mostly thinking this is taking too long, I don’t have 25,000 bucks yet, then saw SPI went up like 400% so I sold everything I had and yolo’d into it.

Started going up a little bit but then started dropping fast, “oh fuck the bubble is popping”, and in an attempt to cut loses I sold everything and lost like 75 bucks.

It rose back up a little so I thought it was coming back and yolo’d back in. Fucking terrible idea, even Fat Man fell slower. Shit spiked down, I thought this was the end, mommy’s gonna find out I spent my college money and I lost it all.

I watched as my investment dropped 40%. I bought robinhood gold to get margin as it was dropping because I thought buying it this low was the only way to make back my money. But before I could finish this retarded idea..

Redemption. It rose back up, I could quit right now and only lose 6 dollars. Stocks are steadily going up. I feel a rush go though me.

What if it went up AGAIN I thought.  Obviously it didn’t and I gave up my chance to actually cut my loses like a fucking idiot.

It went downhill like a Nikola and i started losing everything again.

I was about to sell at another loss and be down another 100 bucks because I thought this was the end of SPI having a fun volatile share price but then Robinhood told my to stop fucking day trading and wouldn’t let me sell.

After hours I’m sitting here with about $400 in my account and waiting until tomorrow to sell out.

Even though I lost my money it felt amazing. It felt like drugs watching how you could make so much or lose it all in minutes.

At least I kinda know what to expect now. This is the start of my gambling addiction, wish me luck.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iym8xe/day_1_of_broke/

48,Game Over ($OUCH),IronTarkus20,1600900972,"So as it turns out, stonks do not always go up.

To give a brief tale of woe, I launched into OTM PCG Gang Calls, OTM SLV Gang Calls, OTM AAPL Calls, and then OTM VALE FD's back to back over the course of about two months. Long strings of words with compelling reasoning certainly brought my cock up into a raging stiffie, and I proceeded to YOLO into several different losses. What can I say? A fool and his money are soon parted. Fortunately, it's just money. 

Part of me wants to say ""I'm never coming back and following some retard into the abyss again"", but let's be honest. I'll be back after a couple of paychecks. If there's any lesson to take here, it's that the better a DD seems, the worse it actually is. The only play I actually made any goddamn money on was fucking Rent A Center. 

And yes, I know, 14K is chump change. Just figured y'all might appreciate some good ol' loss porn in these trying times.

My personal opinion, I’d rather own 7K shares of a $1.50 stock and ride the daily waves, than 50 shares of a major Corp. 

IE: $100 stock jumps to $105 5% gain (which is already not common on the daily w/ major corps). 50 X $5 = $250

$1.50 stock jumps to 1.55 3.5% gain. 7K X .05 = $350 net $100 difference.

* The S&amp;P 500 declined by -2.32% today while the NASDaq weakened by (-3.1%). The Russell 2000 showing weakness at (-3.35%). The Dow ended in negative territory at (-1.92%)
* All sectors ended in negative territory today. The best performing sector was Health Care(-1.03%) while Energy(-4.52%)was the worst performer.
* An initial weakness in the mega-cap stocks, however, gradually spilled over to the broader market, and the negative price action appeared to reinforce the idea that the market's recent pullback may not yet have run its course. The CBOE Volatility Index increased 6.4% to 28.58, which was a relatively modest gain. 
* Losses steepened in the afternoon without much interest to buy the dip. Shares of Apple (AAPL 107.12, -4.69, -4.2%) fell 4% while Tesla (TSLA 380.36, -43.87, -10.3%) fell 10% post-Battery Day. On a related note, UBS resumed coverage on Apple with a Neutral rating, versus a prior Buy rating. 
* Separately, the House passed a government funding bill through Dec. 11 that the Senate is expected to pass later this week. Notwithstanding this piece of good news, general uncertainty surrounding the election, the coronavirus, and the economy likely increased the cash appeal.
* U.S. Treasuries, as previously mentioned, finished near their flat lines. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.68%. WTI crude futures gained 1.0%, or $0.39, to $39.94/bbl but retraced those gains after the settlement time.

2. A new round of stimulus is not even close, democrats and republicans can't get on the same page if the printer should go brrrrrrrrrr or just brrrrr
3. Chinese hackers, russian hackers, iraq hackers etc.
4. China trade war is not over. US hit TikTok (WeChat doesn't really care about it's tiny US market), China will probably find a way to hit back. US trade deficit surged to its highest level in 12 years this summer and China isn't meeting its previously agreed purchasing targets
5. This kangaroo market is just retarded. Today up, tomorrow down, but trending downwards as of late. VIX is a measure of uncertainty in the market and things look more and more uncertain.
6. Trump can literally crash the market with just one dumb tweet. There is a lot of tension and pressure on him. How long until he tweets something stupid and crashes the market? u/analfarmer2 can tell you it happens

23,$1.15 million in 7 months!,monstatrades,1600891120,"Hi everybody, I hope you are all doing very well! 

I’m here to write a quick story of my forex trading journey in the past 7 months. When I first heard about foreign-exchange, i started watching videos on YouTube about how successful are some lucky people, and they are the so called 1% who live a life of what many people just dream about. 

So, I decided to do further research about this and how does it really work. A started to learn about candle stick patterns, and money management. Then I got to know that maybe I could be successful in this too, as a seemed to understand fairly quickly how the market actually works. 

I opened a demo account, which had a balance of $5000. I had many ups and down with my demo account, but as i got more into it, i managed to make $25,628,81 in 5-6 weeks. 

This is why I decided to open a live account and start trading with that. I deposited $17,500, and started doing the same strategy that has been working in my demo account. 

After many sleepless night I started to make consistent gains, this showed me that trading is actually a good business. 

At a total I made $1,150,000.00 to proof this I’m posting another picture, you can find that on my page or Wall Street bets.

I hope my post motivates everybody, and I also decided to help other trader who are struggling, because if I knew the things I know now I could have made the same amount of money in 1-3 months. 
So if anybody’s interested for my words and helping you I’m happy to do so. Just send me a private message! 

And I also started my signals group, where I exactly tell you when to place trades, as well I give you my set ups! 

So please check out my photo of my gains! 

I wish you all the best!",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iyhrgw/115_million_in_7_months/

TSLA has an agreement with PLL for lithium  spodumene concentrate. Its a five year contract, which will start supping lithium late 2022.

Ended up losing half of the 4k I started with in April. Was up a decent amount in June but got raped by sideways movement and this recent 'dip'.

Also sold the bottom many times only for shit to moon the next day.

As a service to you all I just liquidated the final stock I had (RKT) for a 200 dollar loss so calls on that probably a safe bet. Need to get out of the market and just focus on my mental health right now.

I did want to thank you all for the laughs. Despite the losses finding this community was the one good thing that came out of this whole experience. You guys are fucking hilarious and never fail to put a grin on my face.

94,BUY NKLA SCREW HEDGES. (not trolling),CCLyolo,1600887554,"I am dead serious about this and I know how rediculous it looks., TL;DR below.

By Monday morning everyone and their grandmother heard that Trevor had been yeeted from the company, the stock dropped to $25 and started to recover.  Some pople started shorting. 

Tuesday morning some dick swinging hedge funds decided to pump the price a bit, liqidated out retail shorts and started slowly opening their short positions instead.

Wednesday, institutional shorts actually get started they successfully liqidate some longs at the 27$~ mark. Next up was the 25$~ mark. Those were also successfully margin called out. We are now at the 22$~ mark. 

Here's the issue with the 22$~ level.  

They blew their firepower on the previous two levels and now  are banking on retail to shit themselves and start selling so they can start closing positions. 

Please feel free to take a look at the volume chart [here](http://imgur.com/gallery/pKmLJ40) they have been attempting to blast through and are running out of liqidity to stimulate a further decline from the 22~ish level.


Another (more important) note:
There are barely any more shares left to throw down in a new short position AND the borrow rate is more than triple a credit card interest rate.  The various firms shorting this have effectively dug themselves into a hole where they will be forced to buy the shares back or sit tight paying an obscene rate of interest.


If retail decides to 'Buy the Dip' it would trigger a short squeeze nearing 24$ as most of the short volume was added sub 24. 

At this stage retail is currently buying the dip given the additional massive new short volume since 1pm with little relative change in price.


TL;DR
Buy NKLA shares, profit from manipulative hedge funds which will be forced to squeeze.

I’ve been following these guys for a while and buying puts as early as July (much to my dismay back then). 

At this point, the end is most definitely near. With the founder stepping down, and more investors seeming hesitant I wouldn’t be surprised if Nikola hits 0 by year end. 

None of this is new info. However, what is new is that the premiums on puts are going up day after day. At this point $25p seems a little too expensive given break even costs. However if we extend the strike to next year and assume Nikola will hit 0, we can get some puts that still have room to grow.

65,Nordstrom(JWN) calls are a MUST buy in my opinion. 💰 Here's why.,CallMeZeta,1600885025,"http://imgur.com/gallery/hOG86xU

Short-Term Position: $15 1/15/21 &lt;-Quick potential gains

Long-Term Position: $20 1/20/23 &lt;-Absurdly cheap at the moment. Perfect to average into over the next few months to reap potentially massive rewards over the coming year.

-*--*--*---*-

Forget the overvalued tech stocks for a moment. Soon enough. Investors will flock to the neglected, serverly undervalued stocks in othrr sectors. And Nordstrom is likely to recieve a lot of the attention. 

Nordstrom is an American clothing retailer for luxury clothing that sell well renown brands such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton and more. Wall Streets current lack of interest in retail has caused this stock alongside fears concerns of a second lock down in other countries has prevented this stock from recovering from the ongoing pandemic. It currently sits 60 percent down from it's highs this year alone.

This is our chance to get in. If you ever want to make large returns. You have to get in early and buy at the bottom. This is that opportunity. The temporary problem is that Wall Street is bundling Nordstrom in with failing clothing retailers such as Macy's. When it's practically in a league of it's own. And when more people catch on, I believe it's going to soar.

**E-commerce**
Nordstrom has built up an excellent online ordering experience that allows shoppers to find items absolutely anywhere in the Nordstrom system. Even if it's the very last one in stock. Nordstrom will get it into the hands of whoever is willing to pay for it. They also do their best to recommend similar items in the event of sell outs to keep the customer engaged. They're customer service is top notch, as they have dedicated stylist putting together entire outfits from their inventory to make the customer experience even smoother. Nordstroms look boards not only in makes the experience of picking outfits simpler, but also insensitivises each individual customer to purchase more items per transaction. This lead to Nordstrom seeing a 50 percent acquisition of new e-commerce customers during the shutdown. People typically prefer not to purchase luxury clothing from retailers such as Amazon. If Nordstrom plays their cards correctly at take this opportunity to liquidate any locations that were failing prior to the pandemic. And focus their attention more heavily towards online shopping. They could be a force to be reckoned with in the luxury fashion industry. 

Nordstrom also has plans to potentially open more Nordstrom rack locations which is a more affordable alternative to their primary locations. These have been fairly well for them.

Revenue took a 16 percent hit this year but as soon as theirs hints of a recovery from this pandemic and investors begin flocking to the undervalued stocks they've neglected. It will be too late for you to get in. You'll be left bag holding overvalued stocks as money is swiftly taken out of tech and more fairly allocated into other sectors.

I'm currently holding calls for $12.25 1/15/2021. Which currently puts me at a break even at just under 15 dollars. NordStrom saw highs of over $40 this year right before the Coronavirus caused a rug pull. And now I'm in a position where I double my money on every $2.25 increase after it hits $15 dollars on the recover runup. My position is currently short term for some potentially quicker gains in the coming months. However if you want to take some LEAPS and reap the rewards over the long term as I plan to begin doing. January 2023 calls have been released. And their relatively dirt cheap, many still only costing a few hundred dollars per contract.

66,Attention all those who lost money on Tesla and are broke and need a chance to recover: SPCE,Mystical_Playz,1600885023,"Now listen up if you had any bullish position on tesla and decided to hold through yesterday like I did - you're down 90%+ probably even though your portfolio was diversified with Tesla and Vale. 

So now you're broke like me and need a solid play to get back your money you borrowed on a loan.

I think I've found the next jackpot - for potential 5x to 10x returns.

 [https://www.space.com/virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-test-launch-october-2020.html](https://www.space.com/virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-test-launch-october-2020.html) 

Virgin Galactic will have test flights of an aircraft on Oct. 1 and Oct. 7. But the real deal is the launch window opening up on Oct. 22. ""Virgin Galactic is now preparing for its next suborbital test flight, which could launch as soon as Oct. 22."" 

Being an experienced trader since August, I have read the charts and can tell you SPCE is probably in for another wild ride. So much of the market is based on investor sentiment rather than technicals, so when investors hear SPCE is about to launch a suborbital crewed test flight, SPCE will have another spike. Just take a look at the charts:

&amp;#x200B;

[Each candlestick represents 1D](https://preview.redd.it/yrznfbezrxo51.png?width=520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14496c4d86e22a3fec01b1f3888297ac5f6629a5)

Every time something good happens, there must be a spike. 

So, what's the catch?

There are several possibilities which I can think of: 

\#1: It works (50%) 

The test flight launches and everything goes to plan and investor sentiment drives above the mid 20s for a while, allowing us to cash in profits. 

\#2: It gets delayed / canceled (35%) 

Pretty much the worst case scenario - Virgin Galactic aren't ready by Oct. 22 to launch the suboribital flight, leading to a massive selloff - might want to lock in profits early for this.

\#3: Not enough hype is generated (14.9%) 

Pretty bad as well - but I doubt this will happen. Still has a reasonable chance of happening though. In this case, the value of the options should still increase but they might not reach the strike price(s). 

&amp;#x200B;

I will post a follow-up every week on Friday if this post gets traction.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: This won't get you anything for the next two weeks probably, so you can take a break and relax - no more sleepless nights hoping Elon doesn't ruin your entire career with one tweet.

Head up, Sorry for my bad English.

A little backstory. I moved to the US when I was 16( 2014) from Viet Nam. Began Highschool with a GPA 3.8, everything was great, I was adapting to the new life. However in my senior year, my dad had cancer( bladder cancer, He is fine how, but its keep coming back) I become the main income of the house, my mom worked too but her income is not enough. I started to work for more extra hours at Panda Express to pay the bills and got slack off at school, graduating  with a GPA 2.7. All my chances for a scholarship went down the drain. I decided not to go to college because a student loan would be the last thing I want in my life right now. Then I started to work at a factory for a credit card company, the pay was good($17), almost double my previous job, worked for 2 years and decided to move on and worked at a weed farm(Colorado). Pay was the same, but I can enjoy the outdoors and lots of fresh air when I am on the farm. I felt the sense of relief. Despite working with weed, I still have never hit a blunt. After a couple of months the farm got disbanded because of legal Issues and I became unemployed, and still now. Now I am 22, still a virgin, and have no friends at all. I decided to put my 5k savings in this volatile stock market and hope that I can make a little out of it, and then I lost all of it. I tried to play earnings, Jamf, RKT and got fucked. Made a little back on TSLA put after the split, switch to call and lose it all. Now my portfolio keeps going down and down. Now I am starting to lose focus and questioning about my life right now. Not because of the 5k I loss, but because I am back at zero in life. I watch friends graduated college, travelling with their love, having fun, success and living their life. And I am just here, standing at one place for many years, barely moving anywhere in this life. I have no emotional support from anyone at all. I cried in bed many time for years, but now I can't shed a tear anymore. Not because I become stronger, but because I start feeling numb. I am starting to lose the ability to communicate with people, my brain just not into it anymore.

Head up, Sorry for my bad English.

A little backstory. I moved to the US when I was 16( 2014) from Viet Nam. Began Highschool with a GPA 3.8, everything was great, I was adapting to the new life. However in my senior year, my dad had cancer( bladder cancer, He is fine how, but its keep coming back) I become the main income of the house, my mom worked too but her income is not enough. I started to work for more extra hours at Panda Express to pay the bills and got slack off at school, graduating  with a GPA 2.7. All my chances for a scholarship went down the drain. I decided not to go to college because a student loan would be the last thing I want in my life right now. Then I started to work at a factory for a credit card company, the pay was good($17), almost double my previous job, worked for 2 years and decided to move on and worked at a weed farm(Colorado). Pay was the same, but I can enjoy the outdoors and lots of fresh air when I am on the farm. I felt the sense of relief. Despite working with weed, I still have never hit a blunt. After a couple of months the farm got disbanded because of legal Issues and I became unemployed, and still now. Now I am 22, still a virgin, and have no friends at all. I decided to put my 5k savings in this volatile stock market and hope that I can make a little out of it, and then I lost all of it. I tried to play earnings, Jamf, RKT and got fucked. Made a little back on TSLA put after the split, switch to call and lose it all. Now my portfolio keeps going down and down. Now I am starting to lose focus and questioning about my life right now. Not because of the 5k I loss, but because I am back at zero in life. I watch friends graduated college, travelling with their love, having fun, success and living their life. And I am just here, standing at one place for many years, barely moving anywhere in this life. I have no emotional support from anyone at all. I cried in bed many time for years, but now I can't shed a tear anymore. Not because I become stronger, but because I start feeling numb. I am starting to lose the ability to communicate with people, my brain just not into it anymore. I don't know why I am writing this, and don't know what to expect from this, but something telling me to write it down.

29,"Buy NKLA, Screw hedges.",CCLyolo,1600882178,"Hello fellow Yoloers.

NKLA has been agressively shorted today by many institutions, spiking the borrow cost and effectively nullifying the number of shares available to short. 

As of now the shares available to short has declined by 50% from this morning and the rate to borrow has shot through the roof. This is indicative of the price change being largely due to short selling NOT retail liqidation.

This means there is a record number of short positions in the stock, interestingly enough it turns out to get out of a short you need to BUY the stock back which can push the price up.

Some brokers have removed the ability to buy NKLA on margin to protect their short positions.

The best way to profit here is to BUY NKLA.. wait for shorts to squeeze.. profit.

We could have a repeat of the Hertz bankruptcy moon.

I have just opened an account with IBKR but if there any other brokers that allow this I would be happy to know about it.

Basically, I am worried about creating a vertical spread and having someone exercise the sold option early without me realising, then finding that bought positions ends up losing a lot of value before I realise that the sold option was exercised. This could result in a very large loss.

Is there a way to link the two so that if my sold option is exercised, my bought option will automatically be closed at the market price, there by ensuring that the spread between the value of the bought option and the value of the sold option what sold for does not become very large.

73,Biden is good for TSLA?? (Yahoo Finance),fuddermuffin777,1600879372,"With all due respect to Tesla ‘Battery Day’ attendees on Tuesday, it’s the presidential polls they should be watching more right now — provided one is a Tesla investor who has speculated big on the stock in recent months.

“There’s a lot of [electric vehicle] financial incentives and subsidies Joe Biden has proposed which would really benefit Tesla,” said CFRA senior analyst Garrett Nelson on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade. Nelson, who covers Tesla for CFRA and has been critical of the stock’s valuation in the past — thinks a President Biden could unlock further earnings power for the EV maker.

Nelson adds, “For example, talking about building out the number of EV charging stations in the U.S. which currently stands at about 27,000. Biden wants to increase that by a half a million. So that would be a 20-fold increase in the number of EV charging station in the U.S. which would help Tesla tremendously. Biden also wants to increase both tax credits and tax breaks to really stimulate both the production and sale of electric vehicles, which we think Tesla would benefit from as the only electric vehicle maker.”

To Nelson’s point, Biden’s EV proposals cut across three different lanes as a means to stimulate demand. All three would not only be good news for the bottom line of Tesla, but to General Motors, Ford, Toyota that are all racing to get EVs to market within the next five years. Even Amazon through its investment in electric truck maker Rivian could see a Biden boost.

First, Biden would offer rebates for consumers to swap out older, less fuel efficient cars for electric vehicles manufactured in the United States. The plan mirrors the Obama era administration’s ‘Cash for Clunkers’ scheme that came at the height of the Great Recession in 2009.

Meantime, Biden would like to upgrade the government’s fleet of autos to electric vehicles. At the moment, the government uses a wide range of suppliers for its various autos — from GM for the president’s Cadillac to Ford pickup trucks for border patrol. One would have to think Tesla and its all-American production story stands to play in any government car upgrade.

And then lastly is Biden’s plan to add a half million new charging stations. That would go a long way to reducing the range of anxiety inherent to many drivers fearful of switching from gas-powered cars.

Maybe Tesla CEO Elon Musk wasn’t so crazy at ‘Battery Day’ when saying he would like to produce 20 million cars a year (up from 500,000 or so today).

&amp;#x200B;

[Shit, Shit, Shit...](https://preview.redd.it/z10pjsquaxo51.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=167907cec84e6ab4119eae036e2c75d7bf3fc011)

Think through the implications of this statement. If Trev is the source of all ideas and execution driving the company, then his loss is a massive blow to their continued existence, growth, and potential profitability. Looking through this lens, the Hindenburg report ended up removing a key part of NKLA, thus damaging it's ability to deliver on promises. They have clearly said they are fucked if he leaves, and he's gone.

However, if Trev ISN'T the Genius Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist NKLA says he is, then NKLA straight up lied in their 10-Q for some reason. This means the market is dealing with a bunch of liars and frauds who are fully capable of slapping bullshit in a 10-Q to satisfy the ego of a sociopathic liar and fraud. Or, maybe they thought he instrumental, which means they are morons, fools, and/or outright frauds themselves. His instrumental moves include painting decals and rolling non-functional trucks down, what does this say about NKLA's management?

One or more of these things is true, any one of these deserves a good short position until they demonstrate change and honesty.

83,Most Undervalued TECH Stock in the Market: WEIBO WB and SINA,1xndsu,1600878630,"Copy pasta much of what's in Weibo's quarterly/annual filings. There is an arbitrage opportunity, similar to when yahoo owned BABA stake, but both WB and Sina are undervalued. Reporting Q2 earnings a month late (it's coming Monday, 9/28) because their founder and chairman, Charles Chao, saw how undervalued the securities are and has been in talks to take Sina private.

**The numbers really don't lie here:**

* WB Monthly active users (""MAUs"") were 550 million in March 2020, a net addition of approximately 85 million users on year over year basis. 
*  WB Average daily active users (""DAUs"") were 241 million in March 2020, a net addition of approximately 38 million users 
* **WB Operating income** **for 2017-2019**, respectively: 407.5MM, 609.2MM, and 597.6MM
   * **Twitter's operating income** in same time frame: (95.4MM), 423.5MM, and 390MM
* WB Close to 1 debt to equity ratio with 1.1 Billion in cash as of 3/31
   * Twitter: 0.73 d/e, with 3.1 Billion in cash as of 6/30
* WB Cash flow from 2019: 610MM
   * Twitter FCF 2019: 763MM
* WB and Sina M.cap respectively: 8 billion and 2.4 billion
   * Twitter: 36.7 Billion. 36.7!!!!

What I don't understand from Twitter's financial statement and would appreciate an explanation is the fact the company has over 1.2 billion  and 845MM in tax benefits for '19 and '18, respectively, which has led to the huge boost to income for the two years.

&amp;#x200B;

What I do understand and qualitative things to consider:

* Sina owns 44% of WB.
*  Chinese OpEX and CapEX is relatively cheaper per dollar of sales. 
* China's economy is  on it's way back and because the world is in ""get the ball rolling again"" mode, we should see their govt. lax some restrictions that have been placed on Baidu and Weibo.
* Chinese govt. has been the reason to the lack of revenue growth and reason why revenue lags the healthy growth seen in monthly/daily AU.
* Trump presidency may delay and flatten the trajectory of China's economy for four more years, but really, China will eventually become bigger than the US economy.
* Charles Chao's lowball takeout offer has limited the stock performance of Sina and Weibo. What a piece of shit.
* **Classic buy the rumor, sell the news performance coming out of Twitter in this election year.**
* Markets are crashing

So please, please, PLEASE tell me how tf WB and Sina are so fkn cheap. If you can't, then buy the fuck out of this name. But please have the money to double down in case WB continues to move retardedly because the market may continue trending lower.

The biggest problem with belief in market fundamentalism and true free markets right now is establishing a position that can protect you from the conditions required to restore us back into a more fundamental environment. Given this, there are two basic methods to go ""short"" on the market. 

The first of which is options, derivatives, or other contrarian or ""inverse"" instruments that allow you to profit off of market downturns in the short run. 

The second is metals.

Now the issue I have come to realize is that the conditions for each success is contradictory. Metals thrive in an inflationary environment with increasing stimulus and M2 money supply, but so do markets, technically. Holding a long position in gold means you believe in further stimulus, crash of the dollar, and increase in prices, including equities. 

The point is, if you're simultaneously holding options or derivatives to hedge against a crash, that bet will fail in light of your metals theory being correct. The same apples to the reverse situation. No stimulus=crash=potential recovery of the dollar=runaway from metals.

The ideal situation is an initial crash and lagged inflation so that you can harvest your market short positions while being able to enter/average down on gold. The issue here is:

How much does gold crash?
If inflation is coming, then how long can it be before our metals bets spoil and turn into ""breakeven"" positions?

The ultimate conclusion i have come too is that if you are going extremely long on gold (10+ years), your entry point may still matter, especially if youre in market short position( i.e. look at at 2010 until now). If you believe correction territory is much more eminent than long term inflation in equities, the best move may to be to stay in shorts while exiting metals/reducing exposure to about 10% of portfolio. 

The risk with this is if gold decides to resist a market crash somehow and rally.

What do you guys think?

Better still, today we have a new addition to the free marketplace, Corsair Gaming $CRSR, and I believe they are a serious buy right now and are getting overshadowed by current events and blue chip news. 

Allow me to bestow on you three, Adderall fueled, simple reasons that I believe they will continue to rise not only short term, but as a value stock to saddle up and ride your wife does on Wyatt’s cock every day while you’re at work. Fuck Wyatt.

One (Quantitative): Of the 100 most recent IPO’s in 2020, 22 have lost money since IPO and 71 are up since release. 76% have been profitable, a combined 4009% up, including losers. With all those tasty +200% gainers mixed in, positive IPO’s are up an average of 67% and those that are down are down an average of only 23%, Jall feel?

Two (Qualitative): Corsair makes the good shit, If you have ever looked at or built a PC you know what I’m talking about. They make virtually all components in a computer besides cpu, graphics cards, and motherboards, which leaves all the simpler, non computing parts, in which they dominate; they are a high quality standard. The simple fact in life is that the companies who make cooler, cleaner shit, tend to thrive, assuming they don’t price themselves to oblivion. Example: AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL, use ur imagination Want to fact check this? Go to newegg.com and look at components, and then sort by corsair and tell me they don’t fuck.

Reason Three (Trend): As we know tech is some crazy shit in today’s market and their recent IPOs have been no different. Of the last 8 notable tech IPOs, 6 either popped up the first bit or are currently up. 

Naturally, since you’re here listening to me you’re retarded. Same. I think we have here a chance to make some money and minimize risk. Lol, I know ill stop, I know how dumb I sound. But since this is an IPO you can’t lose all your money even if you tried. Could be a nice break from the recent ass-bleaching we have all taken over the last few days.

9,The day Elon Musk gave a realistic timeline,consideritred23,1600877263,"It's 4AM, Elon's head pops of the pillow ""I forgot about Battery Day...""  


He jumps out of bed and quickly checks on X-AEF32, sound asleep in his cryo-mars prep-cocoon. ""Sleep tight my little God-Emperor"" he whispers.

Hurriedly he looks around the room for his Neuralink beta-test rig, and then remembers it's embedded deep in his frontal lobe. 

""Enter second level of sim""

 A man's voice answers sounding just different enough from Paul Bettany to be litigiously meaningful ""Good morning, sir. Passphrase please""

""Order of magnitude""

He sinks in. Thousands of bookshelves whiz by. He researches cathode and anode technologies from first principles. He has his daily chat with (ai)James Clark Maxwell. Identifies the mistakes made in the industrialization processes of batteries to this point in history and pin points the manufacturing synergies that Tesla has in place to solve the problem. Weeks and weeks go by and then all of a sudden he has done it. He takes a step back, combs through his wispy beard and whispers ""step change"".

""return to first level sim""  


He looks at the clock 4:15AM. Plenty of time to go over his presentation notes. He sees the bullet point marked ""timeline"", and Elon as he has done so many times before begins writing ""beta in months, meaningful production by end of year"". X-B52 coos gently from his cocoon and Elon stays his hand. 

He ponders ""What if this time was different? They are not children prepping for Mars colonization. They are fully grown adults who can handle the reality, that difficult engineering of a planet saving technology will take time to build"" He writes ""3 years"".  


......  


Jimmy Bets wakes up is 4AM ""I forgot about Battery Day...""  


He rolls over to check on his wife's boyfriend, he is sleeping soundly. ""Sleep tight my little God-Emperor"" he whispers.

He Googles for Battery Day and finds the article he is looking for ""blah blah Battery Day blah Elon"". He begins veraciously skimming ""blah blah Elon blah cathode blah 3 years blah..........3 YEARS, wtf, 3 YEARS, MY CALLS EXPIRE FRIDAY. Elon is a cuck""

I'm gonna skip straight to the tl:dr of my point here:
 Silvers time is now. Its going to hit its lowest point within the next week or so, and from there it's going to rise back up like a phoenix from the ashes and surpass 30, then 35, 40 and so on until 50. Buy the dip, the train leaves for tendie town soon.

Fwiw I'm 50% down after being margin called on spot, and I plan on getting a loan to buy a ton if it hits $20, and if not then I'm going to get back in once the uptrend resumes, probably around $25.

37,Never Give Up on Losing Positions with a Future,SnapPunch,1600875636,"A few years ago I bought shares of TWTR for 46.06 on 6/18/2018 and proceeded to watch TWTR tank for the next two years. I had an opportunity to sell right below my original purchase price on 9/18/2019 but again failed to take up this opportunity. Today I sold all of my shares of TWTR for 46.06 and closed out that position at true net neutral.

Honestly there is a lot I should have done better when picking up this position over two years ago, but I have learned since then. I know this strategy will not work for every stock, but if you are holding a stock that you know has a future and you know will go up again, then you should never give up on it. As long as you can afford it I think it's better to hold onto a losing position with a future rather than sell for a loss and realize those losses.

On the customer-facing side, Tesla owners couldn’t connect to their cars through the mobile app starting at around 11:00 PM EDT.
As for the website, it is returning an error beyond the main page with no configurator working at the moment

The same is happening for Tesla’s energy products with Tesla solar and Powerwall owners not being able to monitor their systems.
Tesla’s network outage appears to be global with owners around the world reporting the same issue.

I am a political science student and am writing a paper on campaign finance. Opensecrets.org is a website that tracks campaign financing and politicians investments.Prior to the 2016 election President Donald Trump held a large position in Bank of America. This position was never sold but the asset was transferred to his son to manage. When looking at the election large banks all rank within the top 200 out of all special interest groups and lobbyists. They have “donated” to both sides almost equally the expectation is City Group who has only contributed to Joe Biden. Both speaker of the house and senate majority leader have large stock holdings in Financial sector ETFs and mutual funds. In the Care’s act their was portion in it that D regulated the sale of sunscreen. Hunter Biden also owns two Hedge Funds that are he heavily invested in the financial sector. A law that Johnson and Johnson have been lobbying for for years. Currently Bank of America is lobby for a bill that would relax home loan restrictions. They have also been granted over 50 pattens in non traditional currencies. Bank of America is playing both sides of the political game no matter what side the election goes Bank of America comes out on top. With so many of the top politicians in Washington having a vested interest in Bank of America. Along with many leading investors. The politicians will not allow Bank of America price to fall.

78,DOMINO'S PIZZA $DPZ - the no brainer earnings play that nobody is talking about,audioaxes,1600873074,"Earnings date is estimated to be on 10/13, roughly 21 days from now... and about when you generally start to see significant earnings date momentum.  Last quarter DPZ went on a 13% run before earnings.   Needless to say pizza is king during this pandemic world; delivery/takeout friendly, convenient and economical to feed groups, etc.  And from the anecdotes I seen the pizza business is just as busy as its been anytime this year.

I must disclaim that the options are low volume with some very high spread on many strikes (which I think is caused by very few wanting to risk selling options on this without a huge markup on premium).  But IV is pretty low, currently stock prices are down overall from 1 month highs and its still recovering from its ex dividend rate so there is plenty of room to run up.

Talks between electric-truck maker [Nikola](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NKLA) Corp. [NKLA **-5.96%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NKLA?mod=chiclets)and several potential partners, including [BP](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BP) [BP **-0.65%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BP?mod=chiclets)PLC, to build hydrogen-refueling stations stalled following allegations [the company had misled investors](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nikola-denies-short-sellers-fraud-allegations-11599848464), according to people familiar with the matter.

**The setback is the first outward indication that the controversy around the report is impacting the startup’s ability to execute its business plan.**

Nikola executives felt they were making progress toward finalizing an agreement with at least one major energy firm, when short seller Hindenburg Research released a critical report casting doubt on the company and its statements about the readiness of its technology, the people said

The conclusion of this deal was put on hold, the people said, as Nikola responded to the accusations [outlined in the short seller’s report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nikola-stock-got-torched-by-a-short-seller-11600867055), which the Phoenix-based startup has called false and misleading.

Potential partners have been reluctant to move forward amid the heightened scrutiny, but a deal could still come together, the people said.

Nikola doesn’t comment on speculation and is continuing to work on potential partnerships, a spokeswoman said. A BP representative declined to comment.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department have [opened inquiries involving those claims](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-probes-electric-truck-startup-nikola-over-claims-it-misled-investors-11600199462), The Wall Street Journal and others have reported.

Monday blew donkey dicks lets just admit that now. Battery day got hyped to Mars and Elon pulled a challenger. He just blew it up by speaking skynet terms. This morning I avoided opening my account just so I didn't go short and long on $rope, followed with an investment on $booze and $gun, just incase $rope went tits up, I opened up robbed in the hood, and was shown a sea of red. It seems like everyone is liquidating their top gainers just incase we are on a down trend instead of a correction. As we all know Thursdays and Fridays are bad. Most brokers don't front the cash after a sale, and make you wait 3 days for it to clear. Well..... Mondays are typically green due to the fact you gamblers can't blow massive amounts of money over the weekend, other than penny slots and lotto tickets. So big sell of tomorrow and panic selling Friday, followed by green on Monday. But hey, I also don't know shit, and I plan on cashing in on a few puts and grabbing a call Friday before close.

75,"Papa's son is Archangel. We can infer $TSLA, $VALE, and $ZM must go up.",ArockSupertastic,1600866668,"In a Form 6-K filed Monday, $VALE updated its INTERNAL RULES OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE. Of this three member committee, one must be Vale's Chairman of the Board, leaving two slots for independent members.

I have it on good authority Papa Musk has recently flown by jet to Rio de Janeiro multiple times. The reason why he has kept the $5B investment in $VALE a secret, will come to light, as I will lay out my findings below.

Papa musk has focus right now on the machines that make the machines. Now we have a hint of his future vision, and he will soon be going plaid. He is in process of switching on the secret hyperjets. Not only will $TSLA's vertically integrated manufacturing be so efficient it will bankrupt any competition unable to keep up, but as soon as The Gigas (Berlin/Austin/Shanghai) are completed and have scaled up production, he will initiate the next phase. The machines that make the machines that make the machines.

Think about this. With 3 factories scaling production to 1M cars per year, revenues could reach $135B with a $45K average retail per car. To attain a $25K Model 2, there will be much more demand than could be supplied, and so more factories will be needed; exponentially more. Therefore I expect 6 more factories to be created solely for Model 2 production.

Soon, $TSLA, in cooperation with SpaceX, will Dyson sphere the sun and use that energy to Grey Goo. Since Mercury has only an 88 day orbit, and is composed mostly of iron and nickel, it will prove to be an ideal source for $VALE to mine the materials of replication; and passes frequently enough to rocket the ore home. By mining to Mercury, we remove the environmental impact from Earth. SpaceX will beam the Dyson sphere energy home via Starlink. All of this will be enabled by Zoom meetings; $ZM.

**TL;DR**

$TSLA will increase range 50% , attain 50% lower battery cost, 1 million car production per factory, next phase is 6 million car production of $25,000 Model 2, machines will soon be making the machines that make the machines, SpaceX soon to Dyson sphere the Sun, $VALE will move mining operation to Mercury, Starlink enables Zoom everywhere on earth as well as inner Solar System. Zoom must therefore moon.

Long $TSLA, Long $VALE, Long $ZM

This was no fault of their own and the company actually performed exceptionally beating earning expectations by a huge margin.  Nonetheless, investors decided to dump it due to the uncertainty with COVID-19 and possible mortgage defaults due to unemployment.  Well home sales have since only continued to rise and in August we reached a 14-year high spurred by historic low interest rates [https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/22/success/existing-home-sales-august/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/22/success/existing-home-sales-august/index.html) .

What does this mean to you?  Well $RKT is also at a very low price due to the recent market correction and tech sell-off.  IPO was at $18, huge run up to $33 before earnings and now sitting at $21.  The September correction is almost over and stocks will return to their normal prices because investors have nowhere else to put their money.  Bank interest rates are shit, and keeping cash under the mattress is risky because your wife's boyfriend could find it.  

The only unknown here is the presidency.  The way I see it, whichever side wins will undoubtedly want to help sustain a healthy economy.  Well there is nothing better for a healthy economy than real estate assets.

""After having my name dragged through the mud this week by two separate companies, I can no longer maintain the claim that ***the future is mine***,"" the enigmatic inventor and visionary said through the medium.  Gathered around the conducting medium was an enlarging crowd of neck-bearded individuals claiming to be from an online group called WSB..

""Perhaps I should have not been so hard on Edison and Ford.  At least Ford produced an actual car.  And don't get me started on the perpetually moving target of a a low-cost electric vehicle.....Three years, $25,000?  Come on....Henry made a low-cost means of transit for the masses when cars just came into existence!""

""Three years?  Do you know how many Hugh Jackmans I could make you for far less than $25K in three years?""

The seance ended with Tesla stating ""I fear this week has done more to inevitably solidify the presence of the internal combustion engine than any event in prior history.

25,After years of Deep Meditation and Research I have come up with the BIG Bull Theory,joeythekidisamon,1600855209,"So basically the market is like a Pyramid made out of Tetris blocks. The buyers who got in early are the base of the Pyramid. They are the people who cause the sell off because they are looking to collect profit.

The BIG Bull Theory © : The base has been selling off the past two weeks the base above them has planted its feet into the sand. Like the base before them, they are waiting to take profit, but want a run up to make it worthwhile. Typically after a massive sell off people are scared to jump in right away, so big money will lay bricks to honeypot you into buying the head. The scared people wont jump in right away because people think it's a trap, and it is, so to convince you to buy in they will keep building until people are extremely bullish in the trend, and think it cannot collapse. This is the BIG Bull Theory © .

So buy CALLS this morning. It's free money. They wont expect it. They are hoping you are too scared to jump in.

So many gay bears here dont realize how much global warming will fuck us over the next decades, EV is literally unavoidable. Its our only hope. Not just cars, but every where. We cant use fossil fuels much longer or else we literally kill the entire economy.

TSLA is battery tech leader and yesterday they turned it up to 11. The mining improvements alone are worth more than every other auto company combined. And then we have the software part, with TSLA being the market leader in self driving, which will only increase.

Value of battery tech: at least $1T
Value of AI/software: at least $500B
Value of the auto production: at least $100B

That gives us a combined market cap of $1.6T and this is as conservative as you uncle Bob, who btw knows you are gay.

Thats literally 4x the current market cap. And I just used what we know today. Show me one big company that is undervalued by so much. The issue is, ppl look at the auto manufacturing part and try to evaluate it that way. And back to the beginning of my posts, thats like valuating AMZN market cap according to book sales.

I got in at $433 on Monday. And now it looks like it will go to $300 and lower which means I can’t sell until 2022 until it comes back up. And have to live with this stress for 2 freaking years.

Also, the only ETF I found that invests in rhodium is DWS’s Rhodium ETF (XRH0). Another way is through the main producers but they are few (eg  Anglo American Platinum, Sibanye, Impala, Zimplats) and diversified into other metals like platinum and palladium. But there's a relatively small company named Sylvania Platinum that currently gets over 50% of its revenues from rhodium. The thing is that the shares haven't moved much since March and if the price of rhodium keeps these levels for a while, the valuation is around 2x EV/EBITDA.

Taking all of this into account, what do you think is the best strategy to profit from rhodium's insane price?

With everything Elon and his team outlined on battery day, they over the next few years are going to kickstart the current plateauing of battery costs and density.

It will take them a few years to have this up and running on a global scale but when they do Tesla will be the most expensive company in the world exceeding Apples current 1.91T (at time of post).

However, with this amazing news Tesla has dropped almost 7% in after market trading. The fundamentals of the company have only got better, so with that in mind I believe today of all days is the best time to buy more Tesla stock... in 5 years time we will all wish we could have bought in at this price.

First: Follow all recommendations on WSB. They will always work! Also those loss porns. Those are just Satire and want to confuse you. After that choose any stock and start drawing some shampoo lines on the fucksticks until you feel happy and would hang it on your fridge. 
Now from here it becomes tricky. Go with your mom shopping and as soon as you get in the car tell her you forgot to buy something. Of course you forgot your wallet and need her black amex (with pin) to buy a small redbull. So you withdraw 80k and buy a large redbull. You go back and tell her it was a bit more expensive. 

Alright now deposit all to your money making machine aka trading platform. Follow the newest posts option positions on WSB and buy some lowkey stock with a 100x leverage. I would suggest to keep some money on the side. Now for every stock you want to invest you flip a coin (there is a cool app on the app store!) to see if it goes up or down. Buy options, stocks and bitches with the huge amount of stonks you make and reinvest always again. 

So you finally came to an end: You went from 75k to 4 million in 5 weeks and then back to $9. Yes if should have pulled it out at 4 million but I mean, you should have also have pulled out by the bitch who gave you the full program for 5.99$ down the road beside the crackheads.

Eric Spoelstra has proven to solve a very dangerous puzzle… he’s managed to strike the balance between raw athletic talent/gritty players, veteran leadership, abled playmakers and accurate shooters. You combine this with a competent coaching staff plus Jimmy Butler who fits a little of all of those molds and you have a chance to beat anybody in the league. 

*Bet $400 to return $770*

**= RETURN of $370**

For you dumb fucks who cant see the connection I’ll map it out nice and pretty for ya:

\*\*\[Extensive chart explaining why the heat are going to at least make it a close game\]\*\*([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wXY\_Wkb4968Db3fnrUv8mTvYDbmPKtGLh\_4h2zBU4ps/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wXY_Wkb4968Db3fnrUv8mTvYDbmPKtGLh_4h2zBU4ps/edit?usp=sharing))

**Outcome 2: The Celtics win a close and highly contested game.** 

I think these teams are very evenly matched. I see every game being an absolute battle. Yes, I think Miami will take in 5, but I could also see it go 7 very easily. 

If the Celtics make this into a close game then Tatum and Brown are going to have to perform moderately well. For this reason, I'm taking the Celtics winning with Brown to score over 20.5 AND the Celtics winning with Taytum over 4.5 Assists. Taytum has taken his game to the next level. He reminds me of the jump LeBron made when he went back to the Cavs… he is now looking to score by making extra passes. It’s a thing of beauty to watch. 

You see, even if the celtics win I have an alright chance of still coming out alive with my groceries paid for the week. Isn’t that always the goal? Yes my backup is your goal bitch. 

\*\*DISCLAIMER:  I’m not a fan of gutsy  parlays. Parlays are usually terrible bets, but if you can find one to match a game script you predict they can be very profitable.\*\*

*Bet $100  to return $366*

*Bet $100 to return $282*

**= RETURN of $648** (-400 for losing the heat game) 

**Outcome 3: Heat win but it's a closely contested game.**

This is pretty much what happens if all of my predictions are accurate. The celtics play well. Taytum gets over 4.5 Assists and Brown hits over 20.5 points. The heat win so they are shooting well and Jae Crowder hits 3 threes (which shouldn’t be a touch task because he’s averaging 3.3 in a game in the playoffs). 

If this happens we take home turn our original $400 bet on the heat into $2148.

*$400 on heat winning turns into $770*

*$100 on Brown over 20.4 pts turns into $266*

*$100 on Tatum over 4.5 Ast turns into $182*

*$100 on Crowder over 2.5 Threes turns into $200*

***Return of  $2148 (-200 on lost celtics bets)***

**Conclusion:** \*\* If my main analysis is slightly right I will turn $400 into $770. If my analysis is very right then I will turn 400 into $2148. However, if my analysis is wrong and the celtics’ one two punch of Taytum and Brown is too much to handle then I will still turn 400 into 648. That’s the beauty of hedging. If you’re going to be a reckless degen like I proud myself on being,  don’t be a complete dumbass. Hedge ya god damn bets. We are all wrong sometimes, at least this way I give myself a little cushion!\*\*

After examining the DIS daily chart, I have came to the conclusion that we are seeing a very bullish opportunity presented to us. DIS has been beaten down the past 2 weeks, with a strong gap down on Monday seeing lows of 123.50. DIS has held its uptrend channel fairly well since march, breaking out only 2 times (both to the upside). On Monday, DIS bounced perfectly off the support line of its trend - but what confluences me the most is the significance of this point. Not only is this the support line, but it is also the 200 day EMA as well as the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement point. There is also still a partial gap left behind from Monday, and we all know what happens to gaps. A call sweep was detected today totaling $145k in premium for the January 2021 140c, 350 contracts total. And last but not least, we also closed just above the 50 day EMA today as well.

If you were not sure of teslas valuation before battery day shit just got real. I have 800+ shares and lost over 40k in AH alone. At first i felt like i had an eggplant shoved up my ass but after actually using my head to think instead of my shriveled nuts to react i realized the battery day event was the greatest event to happen for tesla longs yet. 

So for those who lost on the short like I did, wipe off the load of cum that the battery day just shot in your eye and pick yourself back up. We are in the middle of a complete paradigm shift and revolution in “laptop on wheels” as papa elon put it.

69,IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR VALE BAG HOLDERS,SatoshiSZN,1600843194," 

Alright fuck it I’m saying it, everyone knows the stock market is fake and gay and there's still ZERO reason for Vale to not go to mars. Those of you who have been paying attention to EV battery supply and the direction it needs to go understand this. The same people have also most likely been noticing Vale's stock price get held down since 9/17 for no reason. If we don't see a pre market run up then maybe I can accept the fact that I've officially lost it but the good news is I’m not allowed to touch my contracts till I know if I’m fucked or not so you might as well hear me out. 

Here’s my positions off rip to validate the logic.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xc2qiwv56uo51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f74cf6fb5f028afce6f2eb84f9fe59caf599fd34

Notice I own two random shit stocks, well that’s because I got my boss to sign up with my robinhood link so that he could buy $VALE for some of these sweet tendies. Too bad RH wouldn’t let me sell the stocks or else I could have afforded another $0.05 contract. Anyway..

If you haven’t done any of your own research into Vale and its connections to Tesla as well as Elon's specific remarks about them, I’d recommend actually taking the time to read the original DD linked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iuk3h0/wanna_play_tsla_but_no_money_vale/) courtesy of the legend u/ExtraEgg blessed us with.

But because I know most of you lazy bears won't read all that I'll just share the most must read article [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-nickel/please-mine-more-nickel-musk-urges-as-tesla-boosts-production-idUSKCN24O0RV). Just read the title of the article and scroll down to wear it says, ""Vale is in the box seat"" for all you need to know I guess.

For some reason nobody cared to do any research on this themselves, so let’s continue as to why I think this stock is still going to moon tomorrow. Like I mentioned earlier, if you’ve been paying attention to Vale for just five whole days, you would notice it getting held down further and further. Take a couple seconds to ask why? If you understand how big the demand is going to be for nickel and manganese then why the fuck would the WORLDS BIGGEST PRODUCER OF NICKEL go down in value? Hmm.. weird right?

(bear with me here Vale bears cause I know your smooth brains might find this shocking)

Guess who has all their fucking money in calls for vale right now? THE FUCKING B/MILLIONAIRES THAT HAVE THE POWER TO HOLD THIS SHIT DOWN. Like hello??? There’s so many reasons for this stock to have AT LEAST had a run up for battery day, yet for some reason it just tanks for days? Not just for days, but still dump after such a highly anticipated event that blatantly showed the importance of producing nickel. So what? I should believe this was a sell the hype sell the news type of stock? Oh and let’s not forget that while this shit is tanking for days, call volume is through the fucking roof for Vale. Not just in the regular markets but also deep pool markets according to a 22 year old kid on adderall in his mother’s basement that’s gone down the same rabbit hole as me. 

There is just simply way too many reasons to not be long on this stock, if you don’t want to do your own research to understand why then you don’t deserve the tendies. 

The next part of this post is going to have to cover why I randomly decided to waste my whole tuesday night writing this shit. So the inspiration for this post has to go out to my dad. I had been sharing my enthusiasm about Vale with him all week, so you can imagine the let down. It was a shame we did not get to see Elon Musk awkwardly run onto the stage wearing chains made out of nickel while “Battery” by Metallica bumps in the background. So you can understand his bearish vibes.

Yet after I was remaining bullish despite vale’s dump after hours that suspiciously recovered quickly my dad messaged me [this link](https://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/929704/which-miners-could-benefit-from-teslas-battery-day-tomorrow-929704.html) to an article saying. “A lot of things mentioned in this. 🙄”

Peep the eye roll emoji, he’s implying that this is bearish for Vale. But why? Well, is it not obvious? At the beginning of the article it clearly states that, “Tesla signed a major deal with Glencore (GLEN) this summer, securing its immediate cobalt needs”. Oh no that’s it boys pack it up Vale is TOAST, Tesla signed a deal with Glencore why invest in another mining company? Well you silly bears, let’s keep in mind that cobalt is known as the blood diamond of EV battery metals. Glencore has its main mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is sketchy as fuck cause they don’t regulate things over there. Remember how the first whole fucking hour of battery day Papa Musk was rambling about how they want to go about production more ethically? 

Side note, even the bears will point this out without realizing why they're playing themselves. This is where people seem to have the most doubt about Vale, because they think Elon would never invest in a mining company that has had previous accidents or scandals. 

Exhibit A:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3ydzw6o89uo51.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80cd3bb282e979064d8509990df68260828a9200

Although there is some truth here, it is not nearly that dramatic. Vale's most recent ""disaster"" was in January of 2019, and is only the second to happen to Vale over four years. Vale has since made significant steps into making sure their mining habits are as safe as possible. The fact is almost every mining company, especially ones that mine cobalt, are going to come with risks of accidents happening. Is Vale perfect? Not at all but it's closer than most if not all of its competitors while also producing the largest amounts of what Elon needs.

So, let’s go back to the question of how to make battery production ramp up more ethically. Well, conveniently enough, removing cobalt from EV batteries all together seems like the best solution, which we learned from today's battery day. Therefore we don’t have to risk mining sketchy ass cobalt in the fucking Congo. Elon knows how dangerous it is to mine cobalt and the need to stay away from it, he also knows that moving out of cobalt is going to make the other components that make up EV batteries that much more valuable. What other metals you might ask? Well if you watched battery day you would know that nickel is the most important metal when it comes to scaling the production of EV batteries. Again, the world’s largest producer of nickel is Vale! Where is Vale located? Brazil. Guess who wants to increase trading relations with the United States? President of Brazl Jair Bolsonaro. GUESS WHO MET WITH BOLSONARO IN BRAZIL IN MARCH. Fucking Musk did, am I sounding like a conspiracy theorist yet? Check [this link](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-will-come-to-brazil-to-talk-about-the-plant-in-the-country) for clarity. It even has great implications for Musk's plans on using solar to help with his goal.

Not QAnon level crazy enough to want to buy in? Look at Elon's recent tweets about battery day. He has used the word ""unveil"" twice. The more recent of the tweets where he stated, ""Important note about Tesla Battery Day **unveil** tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck &amp; Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022."" Elon isn't an idiot, he would not have tweeted this knowing it would crash his own stock without giving his investors an out. That out is right there in the tweet, IN VALE.

Still not convinced? I found a penny face up right outside the door to my car as I was about to go to the bank to deposit some cash for more Vale calls. Then as I was playing Metallica's Battery at a red stop light I SHIT YOU NOT A TESLA ROLLED UP BEHIND ME. There's no such thing as coincidences since we live in a simulation so this is obviously phenomenal news.

But hey I’m just a dude on the internet. If you bears want to keep ignoring the facts surrounding why this company will absolutely sky rocket tomorrow and don’t see that this has clearly been getting held down by the big boys then you don’t deserve the tendies. 

Wish I had more money in my account to blow up for you guys but I'll be posting the gain or loss porn tomorrow with my thoughts.

Thacker Pass Project

First production Expectation Q3 – 2022 (LAC Website)

Q1 – 2023 is also a possibility as the a record of decision by the environmental authorities must be issues by February 5th, after which LAC has said they’ll begin a 2 year construction phase ([https://sierranevadaally.org/2020/08/28/thacker-pass-lithium-mine-draft-environmental-impact-statement-reaction/](https://sierranevadaally.org/2020/08/28/thacker-pass-lithium-mine-draft-environmental-impact-statement-reaction/))

Size: “The current exploration plan boundary encompasses approximately 3,550 acres. The project would involve expanding the plan boundary to approximately 18,000 acres, with an ultimate disturbance footprint of approximately 5,700 acres.” – Bureau of Land Management ([https://www.blm.gov/press-release/bureau-land-management-seeks-public-input-proposed-lithium-nevada-corporation-thacker](https://www.blm.gov/press-release/bureau-land-management-seeks-public-input-proposed-lithium-nevada-corporation-thacker))

This meets Elon’s comments about having permits to a mining site that is over 10,000 acres / the expansion may be a part of an agreement that allow the mining rights to his 10,000 acres.

[https://sierranevadaally.org/2020/08/28/thacker-pass-lithium-mine-draft-environmental-impact-statement-reaction/](https://sierranevadaally.org/2020/08/28/thacker-pass-lithium-mine-draft-environmental-impact-statement-reaction/)

This article is the most interesting one that talks bout the Environmental statement reaction (Same article referenced in the first production expectation section). The draft environmental impact statement was published July 29th and the public comment period ended on September 11th, 2020.

Article says they spent the last couple of years creating processing method using sulfuric acid. Sulphuric acid has been used for hard rock extraction for decades, but this is a new way for sedimentary clay. They said the excess acidity is neutralized to produce gypsum and Epsom salt as by products.  *Note, the Tesla battery day made a point of saying that they had a way that was sulphate free in* ***processing*** *lithium, with doesn’t seem to be in line with the above, unless it is to be updated/released later; It’s also possible the I’m misunderstanding this as my mining / chemical knowledge is limited*

The proect is proposed to be a carbon-neutral mine operation; this seems in line with Tesla’s goals. The CEO, Alexi Zawadzki, made appoint of saying “Once the lithium is dissolved, it can be concentrated and purified to produce high-quality lithium compounds for batteries. Any excess acidity is neutralized to produce calcium sulfate (gypsum, also known as the main material in wall-board) and magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt)”

The article also said that an open pit is proposed with the remediation objective of back filling the hole; Elon made a big point his presentation that their mine would be putting the soil back into the land to return it to it’s natural state (aka remediate).

Finally: ““LNC is evaluating financing options to build the Thacker Pass mine including a partner in the Thacker Pass project. Current regulations restrict certain countries, including China, from owning strategic minerals deposits in the USA and the Company will fully abide by these laws.”

After all of the above, given Musk’s comment’s about Tesla itself obtaining Mining Rights and getting into the mining game, there is some speculation that Tesla could consider buying the mine from LAC (before and after the battery day)

[https://cleantechnica.com/2020/06/27/tesla-terafactories-lithium-securing-the-supply-chain/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/06/27/tesla-terafactories-lithium-securing-the-supply-chain/)

[https://youtu.be/C6cXu1Ln6rk?t=227](https://youtu.be/C6cXu1Ln6rk?t=227)

At this point, it’s a gamble (like everything here), but I’m holding my position. Given the above, and the fact that Ganfeng Lithium (TSLA’s current Lithium provider – see more details and DD @ [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iss0ez/how\_to\_get\_big\_tendies\_off\_tsla\_battery\_day/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iss0ez/how_to_get_big_tendies_off_tsla_battery_day/) ) is the biggest owner at 16.55%, I’m happy to hold.

There’s likely going to be some froth over the next little bit, but I think they’ve get a pretty good shot at being involved in the Tesla Mining project; even if they’re not, the approval of the mine and beginning construction on the project should provide some good PR and keep the stock on a profitable trajectory.

Best of luck you beautiful bastards

LAC owns 18,000 acres of a lithium site called Thacker Pass. Thacker Pass is the only project that has gone through environmental clearance with an environmental impact statement which clears the application for lithium  mining operations. There are no other or any type of documentation clearing operations for other mining operations. It takes about one year to clear permitting and environmental clearance.

iirc... Making their own batteries which are ultimately cheaper for them and way more effective. Youll get more range, the battery will last the lifetime of the vehicle in most scenarios,  and can be recycled. The vehicles will be lighter, more efficient, which is more added range b4 a recharge.


An affordable car at 25k. This is amazing... the car could probably pay for itself just in what you'd save in not buying gas all the time.

And then manufacturing their batteries...no one will be able to match them. Each one of their plants would produce five to ten times what a plant from potential rivals could do.

And then there was Plaid...The model S with plaid powertrain is the fastest 4 door on the planet.


The growth projections for electric vehicles is huge and Tesla not only has the best electric cars and they have the best battery tech.

I think the presentation was too much science and too nerdy for most people...eventually someone will post cliff notes and why it's huge news and people will be.

37,I actually know something useful. Do CMBM,ITWrksSalem,1600830771,"TLWR - CMBM to the moon

I own a WISP (wireless internet service provider). Up until now I was a strict UI fan boy, and lord Pera has treated me to super tendies. 

However the market is shifting as unlicensed frequencies become crowded and CBRS makes getting licensed links much easier and more affordable. 

There used to be several companies in the 3.65 ghz space and most of their equipment sucked as bad as the licensing requirements. UI was the only affordable option. 

UI recently exited the 3.65 market and the other two major players really shit the bed on their deployments. That leaves CMBM as basiclly the only workable, scaleable solution in the market. 

They also have their new Medusa line of licensed/ unlicensed gear that is showing 10x improvements over competition.  

The PAL license auction just happened and there were so many bidders in the 3.65 market that some people were paying 2000% markup for 1 license. 

I called my CMBM distributor today and he told me that there is a 4-6 week wait list just for their company for gear, and every other distributor said the same. CMBM has promised 5x production by years end

The gear is 10x more expensive but we are happily paying based on performance increases. 70k for 8 base stations and 100 customer radios, and thats on a 50% discount. 

They are pulling a TSLA and taking pre-order to get funds to ramp production. I think in the next 6-12 months 50 pps is very possible. 2 quarters from now is going to be a monster beat, and using the discount to get people into the environment seems to be working well

Just look at the run UI made when they became the go to for mid level market wisps. CMBM has the same undervalued, misunderstood market share that UI had when I bought in at $35/share

I was one win away from buying the new condo I've been eyeing. Is it Elon's fault?.. No! It's my fault for being a dumb ass and buying those calls. Will I $Rope? No. But I'll learn from my mistakes. Everyone here cries about working a 9-5 but puts zero effort into becoming a better ""gambler."" Instead they follow the advice of some random 16 year old who says ""ten-bagger guaranteed"". When they lose they blame that dick face for their shitty outcome with no accountability for their actions. Losing money fucking sucks. But stop blaming everything else but yourself. 

These memespiracies have been a hot topic lately. Conspiracies like PRPL and Vale Pump n dumps that the mods allow while removing solid DD. Is this true? I have no idea but probably not. These DD's can seem convincing. But take a step back and ask yourself? Is ""YOLOing"" my entire account on a mattress company during the middle of a pandemic worth it? Hmmm... there's your answer. 

Perfect segway towards my next point... YOLOing. The YOLO flair has become pathetic along with several others. People just make generic comments and flair it as YOLO with no positions. The majority of the rest are $500 ""YOLOs"". No one gives a fuck that you're betting you birthday money grandma gave you. Now the DD flair isn't much better. Too many posts with that flair that should be Shitposts. Now in defense there are still quite a few solid DD's. Of course when there is a wall of text greater that 30 words everyone complains how they can't read. Please mods all I ask is to control these flairs a bit. 

Now I know I'll probably get downvoted into oblivion for this post but I felt the need to give my two cents. Now you're probably asking yourself ""who does this retard think he is?"" Well I know I'm a retard. But every now and then you need another retard to tell his retard friends that they are also retarded. 

TSLA hit me hard so I'll be treading lightly and looking to play UPS earnings. I'll try to make a solid DD on this and I'm open to taking any suggestions on any other potential solid DD's I should make.

90,"$TSLA isn't dead, silly. After hours physics",Mr_Saturn_,1600826109,"In pre-market and after hours trading, there exists significantly less volume and therefore price movements are increasingly dramatic and exaggerated. For example, one can often see WeBullers battling with themselves on popular stocks in the 4-7a pre-market, their own floaty little world where normal market physics don't apply and big swings occur with ease, only to be quickly shut down by profit-takers and deemed largely irrelevant by market open.

So, when traders sell down shares in after hours and there are no bids to buy them, the ask price knifes through the few bids that exist. The joke is on the sellers because if they sold during regular market hours, there would be much more bid volume to absorb their sale at a higher average price. Instead, they achieve a lower average sale price and profit less. This is why sales come down in intervals, allowing bull traps to form to average up the sale price instead of just tearing straight down.

As the exaggerated selloff gains momentum, panic sellers step in to further steepen the drop, selling at any price just to stop the pain which is only temporary because ***tomorrow is a new day***. Profit-takers start the waterfall, only for the frail and weak to willfully drown themselves at the very bottom. &lt;- we are here now

Morning comes and those that sold the top gladly relieve paper hands of their overnight pain and suffering; a baby green dildo is born. Paper hands love buying green dildos, especially the tips, so they start buying back in and momentum takes it from there, until resistance/exhaustion is reached, profit-takers sell down again and the cycle continues.

tl;dr: $TSLA is well oversold and tomorrow it will fill the gap up to at least today's close around $424.

95,Options noob -- what I've learned in week #1,fells77,1600825724,"TL;DR - Making millions is hard when you start with little; adjust your sights and plan ahead

I've been watching people piss their money away on this sub for a while and have enjoyed the RH retards yolo'ing their life savings away -- you've all taught me what not to do as I've entered the exciting world of options trading.

I don't have $96mil to drop on TSLA options and haven't found ""hope"" to be an effective method to do, well, anything (especially making money).  If you want a chance (no guarantees) to actually make money and not just get fleeting WSB fame for being an autist, you're probably going to want a better plan than:

1. buy TSLA calls
2. ?
3. get rich; buy froyo

If you're buying options (or really anything you want to make money off of), figure out how you're going to make the money from the thing *-- wait for it --* before you buy it.  Are you going for a $ amount? % amount?  What's your exit strategy to make money and not be a broke retard?  If you can't see a clear path to your exit strategy from your point of entry (have fun with this one guys) then you probably shouldn't buy.

If you are buying options, remember that time decay is real!  You can buy options with 0-day expiration or weeklies, but monthly gives you a lot more time for your positions to do their thing and better your odds of not making loss porn memes.

Need some better odds?  Swinging for the fences is fun when you connect but more often than not, you'll probably miss.  I know it's sacrilege to not ""to the moon"" here but Superman III had a point:  those nickels and dimes (in our case) add up over not too much time; a $.50 increase in value on 10 options is an easy $500.  Do this a couple times and keep compounding your purchases (and FFS don't go balls-deep with all your coin) and those returns will compound, too.

I'm rounding out week #1 of options trading with a bit under $800 in profit from an initial investment of \~$1500 buying slightly OTM calls based on what I'd call a fair amount of DD (I'm not an investing pro, obviously).  I feel like I have a very loose grasps of the fundamentals (thanks u/InTheMoneyAdam) and probably got some help with the market swings, but remember the name of the game is to make money, not be WSB famous.

We all know covid is not going away anytime soon.  Possible multibagger if their opaganib drug gets approved for use. Clinical trials looking good so far

Details:  Just in today
22 September, 2020

The ongoing global Phase 2/3 study with orally-administered opaganib in patients with severe COVID-19 is approved in Italy, the UK, Russia, Israel, Mexico and Brazil; 16 clinical sites initiated globally to date

--

In parallel, the opaganib U.S. Phase 2 study, with 8 active clinical sites, is approximately 75% enrolled and expected to be completed in the coming weeks

--

Opaganib completely inhibited SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in an in vitro human lung cell model, comparing favorably with remdesivir, the positive control in the study

--

Opaganib demonstrated dual anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity and targets a host cell component, unaffected by viral mutation, thus minimizing the likelihood of resistance

Global emergency use authorization applications planned, subject to positive clinical results

GLOBAL!  But wait theres more!  Already in talks with US government

The Company is in discussions with U.S. government agencies around potential funding to support the rapid advancement of opaganib toward potential emergency use approval.

Market cap is only $369 million.  Been in since $7 and have kept buying here and there.  It's fueling, get in before the rocket launches

Since then, all I can do is try to decipher Elon’s tweets, so here we go! 

Looking at his newest tweet, Elon showcases a Cyber Truck, an ATV, a Roadster, and a Semi with an acronym C A R S. [ C A R S acronym ](https://imgur.com/gallery/AWm100A) 

Yesterday, Elon’s tweet mentioned 3 out of 4 of these vehicles. The Semi, Cybertruck and Roadster. S C R
[S C R acronym ](https://imgur.com/gallery/DEhvstV)

So, it seems to me he’s trying to point to the previous tweet in his most recent tweet. 

We all watched battery day with expectations of a partnership with vale. We were wrong. Another  WSB autist (not sure where this is at) posted another theory about his battery day tweet being on 9/11 and at 6:45 am. 9/11 crash. 645 Pam am, crash. I think this is what Elon was hinting. No way to be sure but Tesla is crashing! All I’m saying, I see something in his tweets. Maybe I’m just as restarted as extraegg. 

Back to S C R.
So I google scr and this pops up, [S C R google](https://imgur.com/gallery/O1iTu7Z)
All that watched battery day knows how he started off the presentation talking about silicone. Lots of anode and cathode mumbojumbo. I’m guessing this is a hint of something but honestly, I have no idea what to do next or how to play this.

Here’s proof, and why mods are responsible for WSB’s deterioration.",LiveNDiiirect,1600823222,"People have been complaining that this sub has gone to shit in the last several months. There was a post earlier today arguing this, citing a lack of quality DD being posted here since March.

It is not that there has been a lack of DD posted, but nearly all quality DD gets deleted by the mods. DD on CVNA was posted yesterday only to be removed by mods, while CVNA shot up 30% today. I have seen users post similar comments in the daily threads over the past few months, saying they posted DD that was removed by mods, only for their predictions to have been right. Some of these users posted their DD in the daily thread instead, some didn’t, but I remember many of these comments ended up ringing true.

Now now now, OP, you might say, mods just want quality DD with charts and fundamentals and “Insider Information.” This is why they let fucking VALE and PRPL guys post pump and dumps, leaving such as the few DD that doesn’t get removed. Even though PRPL guy posted numbers that were undeniably false and proven false by the Earnings Call. Mods let these pump and dumps happen.

Now, here’s the real fucking kicker. On the surface those seemed like fine DD to those who didn’t know better. HOWEVER, I, too, posted “DD” on PRPL: /r/wallstreetbets/comments/i3k4lf/ive_had_a_vision_from_god_and_he_showed_the/

Mods let me keep my PRPL “DD” up, where I cited “visions from god” as the reason to buy calls. This got 137 upvotes and nearly 100 comments. It got legitimate traction and attention. So mods definitely saw it. And they let my post tagged as “DD” remain. This completely disrupts the argument that mods want a certain standard of quality DD when my post with 0 fundamentals, analysis, or any legitimate indication or information to stay up.

You could say that posts like mine are part of the problem. I wouldn’t dispute you. I will say though, that based on how many people have been getting their DD posts deleted, I was sure my post would be deleted, or at least have the flair changed to Shitpost or Satire. However, this proves that the mods left it up to fuel the Purple pump and dump, instead of suppressing what was truly low quality DD. Instead they surprised DD like CVNA that would have captured many of us with 10 baggers today had they left that DD up instead.

Mods here want you to lose and are entirely to blame for the deterioration of this subs quality as a forum to spread useful information to help us make money. I would go as far to argue that, in my eyes, I am becoming convinced that this sub might be being moderated with those with nefarious intentions to leave everyone here holding heavy bags, though we would need more evidence.

If you take a look at NKLA from last Wed to Fri, it consistently jump when market opens then slowly plummets with similar patterns.

NKLA's stock chart from 9/18 until now is showing the same pattern as it did from 9/16 to 9/18. Thus, it could possibly hit 30 dollars tomorrow. Now lets see the chart.

Tesla= What Netflix did to Blockbuster. And blockbuster is currently ever vehicle manufacture on the planet right now. You just don’t see it yet. 

The other day I posted a thoughtful question regarding the long term consequences in the event that Elon created a new ground breaking battery and what that effect that would have on big oil/other vehicle manufactures. The responses varied. 

Some of you are mad about this solely because you lost money on the stock in the short term. You failed to account for the fact that Tesla is already worth 40% of the entire vehicle market which means the market has already priced this day in. The good news is it's only going to get better from here. 

Any company that did not already make the necessary pivot to the EV world is completely fucked. Any of them that did make the pivot will now have to forget everything known about battery tech and start from scratch. This 25k vehicle with the advanced battery and imporved recharge time, extended range, and the fact that it's all made in house and from an abundant resource is going to change the game forever. Also, very few people go from electric back to gas driven so that means every person they grab is a permanent EV driver. 

***This is going to decimate the vehicle market.*** and by cornering the market this will make Tesla reign supreme and lord over all. Every vehicle manufacture CEO right now is already planning their ten year exit from the space and the oil industry is about to take a Rochambeau like kick in the nuts. 

Tesla owns the patent tech on the new batteries so in the event another manufacture tries to compete they will have to license this battery tech from Tesla = money for Tesla. 

Every time Tesla drops its price by 5k it doubles the available matket. They will soon produce a vehicle for 25K which will open the market up to 4x as many people as compared to today = money for Tesla. 

Tesla will push other auto makers out of business by manufacturing a cheaper vehicle. This will consolidate market share = Big money for Tesla. 

Essentially this is the best news you will ever hear as an investor. It's the best 10 year play you could ever make.

So hold your position, stop crying and look at the big picture so you can be fucking rich! 

For those of you still confused think about the history of the flat screen TV. The first one was damn expensive which only allowed for a select few to purchase it. Those select few that purchased it brought in money which allowed for further R&amp;D and price reduction which opened up an even bigger class of people to afford it. That process occurred over and over and now everybody has a flat screen TV in their house.

* The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.1% on Tuesday, snapping a four-session losing streak alongside the Nasdaq Composite (+1.7%), which got an added boost from the mega-caps. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.5%) and Russell 2000 (+0.8%) followed behind. 
* From a sector perspective, the consumer discretionary sector (+3.0%) set the winning pace on the backs of Amazon and Nike (NKE 116.87, +3.50, +3.1%), which rallied ahead of its earnings report after the close. The communication services (+1.9%), information technology (+1.7%), real estate (+1.3%), and industrial (+1.0%) sectors followed suit. 
* Conversely, the energy (-1.0%), financials (-0.8%), and health care (-0.2%) sectors closed lower, limiting today's market rebound. 
* Tesla (TSLA 424.23, -25.16, -5.6%) was another exception after CEO Elon Musk tempered expectations for its Battery Day event today. Mr. Musk said yesterday that new products will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.
* In other developments, Fed Chair Powell and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin testified on the CARES Act before the House Financial Services Committee, and existing home sales increased 2.4% m/m in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.00 million, in-line with the consensus estimate.
* Market reaction was muted to both of these events, but it's worth noting that Mr. Powell reiterated the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy for as long as is needed. 

Looking ahead, investors will receive the FHFA Housing Price Index for September and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.

He didn't mention any of these problems at all in last year's 4/23/2019 autonomy day presentation, insisting that FSD was  coming ""very soon"" and be feature complete in 2019, not needing human attention at all by Q2 2020, and having a million robotaxis in 2020, all  while shitting on companies that use LIDAR. Note that customers kept paying an extra $5k-10k for FSD hardware option, all based on Elon's promise.

15,$RKT going deeper into Fintech 🚀,Zaratar,1600819245,"This announcement came out today, summarizing their 12-month expansion plan to the public for the first time. The original announcement is here: [https://www.qlmortgageservices.com/announcement/](https://www.qlmortgageservices.com/announcement/)

&amp;#x200B;

**The Four Pillars of the Announcement**

1. Rocket Technology: new Fintech platform for lending partners. E-sign, upload, import, improved visibility, the whole kitchen sink. Introducing new ""Pathfinder"" platform for speed and certainty in answers, in partnership with Google. Yes, Google.
2. Rocket Referral Network: Creating the largest network of referral partners in the entire country: a network of real estate agents, financial advisors, insurance agents, etc. Nuff, said.
3. Rocket Marketing: National add campaigns, local add campaigns. Helping industry partners to leverage the Rocket brand. 
4. Handing out 10,000 purchase leads to industry partners. The best way to get their lending partners used to doing business with the new Rocket toolkit.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;**

To reach their target of 25% market share (of the Trillion dollar morgage market), they are taking the IPO money and the boat-load of cash they made this year and putting it into Fintech development, creating better tools, platforms and the largest referral network for their industry partners. This is not your mom and pop's lending office next door, they are going after network effects and massive scalability of software platforms. Their business plan is essentially a ""mortgage-ified"" version of ""Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.""

But today, it's not like that. A presentation like this under this kind of sunlight doesn't look cool. People packed in a parking lot inside their cars, like a drive-in theater. I know it's covid time i get it, but i think, maybe doing it 100% virtual like what Apple did might be better.

Anyway we still love you Musk.

29,Well this is interesting...,Chaoticiant,1600818890,"As you???ve likely observed, elevated option implied volatilities indicate that the markets will be confronting elevated volatility both before and after the November 2020 election. IBKR shares that sentiment and believe it???s appropriate to start controlling leverage in a measured fashion in advance.

Consequently, to protect IBKR and its customers, IBKR will increase margin requirements by as much as 35% above normal margin requirements leading up to the November U.S. election. To illustrate, consider a Reg. T margin account with stock XYZ having an Initial Margin requirement of 50% and a Maintenance Margin requirement of 25%. With the increase fully implemented, the new requirements would be 67.5% Initial and 33.75% Maintenance. Accounts subject to risk based margin will have their scanning ranges increased in a similar manner.

This will be implemented gradually each day, increasing Initial margin requirements from normal levels starting September 28th to a rate that will be 35% higher by October 23rd. Maintenance margin requirements will increase in a similar manner between October 5th and October 30th. The new requirements will be implemented each day, after the market closes in New York, and will be effective the next trading day. 

IBKR may make additional changes to the margin on certain products, or all products, depending on volatility. This includes changes built into the standard margin model as well as any new house margin requirements that may be imposed.

So how can I start a hedge fund and bring in investors? Can they look at my portfolio and see that I've made over 100% in returns? I've stopped job hunting in order to focus entirely on trading at this point. After all, if you're not 100% then fuck off.

**Signifcant quotes from Oxford University:**

**A Case of Early Re-infection with SARS-CoV-2**. From the PDF:

&gt;The clinical, epidemiological, and sequencing data of this case suggest early re-infection with SARS- CoV-2, only 51 days after resolution of initial infection. Importantly, this was observed in a young immunocompetent patient. In contrast to the case reported by To et al., **this second infection was more severe**, potentially due to immune enhancement, **acquisition of a more pathogenic strain**, or perhaps a greater inoculum of infection as the second exposure was from within the household.

Step 3: Realize that the MMs are still holding your tendies hostage and continue to scream at the gym like the attention-seeking whore that you are.

Even if your portfolio is down 99%, you still have that last 1% to go. 

But once you hit rock bottom, you realize money isn't everything. Even though the bank may have foreclosed on my house, my car, and even my wife, I know it's going to be okay. I know it's going to be okay because there is still tomorrow. 

Tomorrow, I start my brand new job giving BJs behind the dumpster at Wendy's in the seedy part of town. I'll be charging by the hour. And after a few years, I will be back to where I started.

 Look at the daily charts of GameStop going back the last 3-4 trading days. GME will pop, fall, then hit hard resistance. This means There is breathtaking selling pressure trying to keep GME from hitting escape velocity. The only thing, is that these money managers will eventually break because there are not enough shares available to keep selling. We will continue to have 20% days until there is a true catalyst.

I bought in because stonks go up, but rarely tits up. 🤣 I shoulda bought the calls dated infinity as I'll never see the money again.

P.s. whoever out their life savings in, it's just money. Sorry for your loss. Loss porn imminent, but we still got til Friday for any last droplet of hope to fade.

77,IBKR will be raising margin requirements by up to 35% until after the election.,yarnhoj,1600813810,"TLDR Go long volatility as we're entering uncharted waters.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Client,  


As you've likely observed, elevated option implied volatilities indicate that the markets will be confronting elevated volatility both before and after the November 2020 election. IBKR shares that sentiment and believe it's appropriate to start controlling leverage in a measured fashion in advance.  


Consequently, to protect IBKR and its customers, IBKR will increase margin requirements by as much as 35% above normal margin requirements leading up to the November U.S. election. To illustrate, consider a Reg. T margin account with stock XYZ having an Initial Margin requirement of 50% and a Maintenance Margin requirement of 25%. With the increase fully implemented, the new requirements would be 67.5% Initial and 33.75% Maintenance. Accounts subject to risk based margin will have their scanning ranges increased in a similar manner.  


This will be implemented gradually each day, increasing Initial margin requirements from normal levels starting September 28th to a rate that will be 35% higher by October 23rd. Maintenance margin requirements will increase in a similar manner between October 5th and October 30th. The new requirements will be implemented each day, after the market closes in New York, and will be effective the next trading day.  


IBKR may make additional changes to the margin on certain products, or all products, depending on volatility. This includes changes built into the standard margin model as well as any new house margin requirements that may be imposed.

Newly IPO’d Compass Pathways (CMPS) is the first psychedelic pharma company on the market. Studies have been going on for a few years with the FDA and have been fast tracked. Many believe we could get shrooms approved for treatment as early as next year. 


Ann Arbor, Michigan is the most recent to decriminalize these magical fungi as well. 


To quote livescience.com 


“Now, the FDA has granted another ""breakthrough therapy"" status to the psychedelic treatment, this time for a U.S.-based clinical trial conducted by the nonprofit Usona Institute, according to a statement from the company. This clinical trial, which includes 80 participants at seven different sites across the U.S., focuses on the efficacy of treating patients with MDD with a single dose of psilocybin.


There are more than 17 million people in the U.S. who have major depressive disorder, or severe depression that lasts more than two weeks, according to the statement. Psilocybin, with a single dose, could profoundly impact the brain and have long-lasting impacts after wiping away depressive symptoms, according to the statement. 


The phase 2 trial is expected to be completed by early 2021, and with the help of this status, Usona expects it to quickly move into a larger phase 3 trial, according to New Atlas. Around one in three treatments previously given a Breakthrough Therapy status have moved on to get market approval, New Atlas wrote.“

Why in the world have these shares not exploded yet? I'll tell you why - the mortgage companies and home builders haven't all reported their earnings for Q3, better yet Q4!!!

I'm looking at Radian, MGIC, and Essent. (Along with dropbox, customers gotta upload docs to get loans). 

People that can buy their homes in cash 10 times over are putting 5% down and paying PMI because rates are so low! If they aren't paying it monthly, they're buying it out in cash!! Typically PMI is around 70/m for a 760 credit score. That's 4500/over 6 years. They can simply buy the pmi in cash for LESS then that and the interest rate is the same. On the flip side, less wealthy customers are paying 300/m for their PMI bc they can qualify with low rates (3.250% with credit at 680). Across the board! 

If you don't buy calls for at least one MI company thru end of year, you have been warned. 

This is simply my analysis after watching the big short last night and typing in different parameters in different markets in the united states for mortgage quotes.

Basically, Facebook wants EU regulators to stop hassling them and have apparently threatened to pull out of Europe. Seemingly, the response of Europeans has been to encourage FB to leave Europe. So, what this tells us is that there is particular animosity building up against FB and this will translate in a large drop in active daily users and engagement. These are the two fundamental indicators that will tell us about the health of FB going forward. Now, we have to consider the fact that there are too many indicators to suggest that Facebook won't be around in the next few years. Am I being full of shit here?

69,Market Insider pushing out bear propaganda,fuddermuffin777,1600809024,"Market Insider article from today:

The S&amp;P 500 has fallen for three straight weeks, and things may be about to get tougher. This week the ""bearish window,"" when investors have the least chance of making money on US stocks, is open, one veteran trader says.

On average, over the past 30 years, September has been the worst month for S&amp;P 500 bulls, with a decline of about 0.32%, compared with April, when the index has registered an average gain of 2.1%.

Welcome to the ""bearish window"" of September 20 to 25, where 30 years of evidence says to expect five days of pain, said Stephen Innes, a veteran trader and chief global market strategist for the brokerage AxiTrader.

""Based on data gathered from over the past 30 years, the 20th to 25th September is the five day window in which you have the least chance of making money in US stocks,"" he [**said in a note**](https://www.axitrader.com/uk/blog/market-analysis/markets-outlook-welcome-to-the-bearish-window) on Monday.

The effect is, generally speaking, an anomaly, not related to any external market event. The past few years of extreme investor bullishness and the trillions of dollars in fiscal stimulus that have flown into the equity market have mitigated this phenomenon somewhat.

Over the past 10 years, on average, September has still been the S&amp;P 500's month of poorest performance, scraping into positive territory with a gain of 0.04%, compared with a gain of 2.5% in July.

However, in the past five years excluding this year, the honor of ""worst month"" has shifted to August, with an average decline of 1.02%, while July has been the top-performing month, with an average gain of 2.5%.

This year, investors are contending with an uncertain presidential election two months away, a Federal Reserve that has shown no signs of injecting any more stimulus into the financial system, and rocky technology stocks that have made tech by far the worst-performing sector this month.

The SPDR Select Technology exchange-traded fund, a proxy for the US tech sector, has lost almost 9% so far this month as investors have booked profits on double- and sometimes triple-digit gains in stocks such as Tesla, Apple, and Amazon. This compares with a 6.3% fall in the S&amp;P 500 itself.

""The Fed story is stale as week-old bread, and their balance sheet hasn't grown since June. At the same time, the fiscal storyline is stuck in the swamp,"" Innes said.

""Compounding matters, we're also on the precipice of traders and risk managers starting to fret about US election risk. There's a remarkable tendency for fear to build, and volatility rises about four to six weeks before voting events, even if we've talked about them for months ahead.""

With several factors stacking up, this year's September bearish window could be more severe, he said.

""There's always a bit of a panic attack around these kinds of events, and this one could be worse when viewed through the coronavirus lens,"" Innes added.

46,Why Robinhood may cause you to lose money,ericzhouh,1600805039,"I have been mainly using Fidelity until a friend of mine introduced me to Robinhood in 2019. I moved 50% of my portfolio to Robinhood. After 1.5 years, my return on Robinhood is -15%, while on Fidelity is 5%. 
I reviewed my transactions and found that I am trading more aggressively on Robinhood. My instincts as a product design manager makes compare the UI design between Robinhood and Fidelity and found the following:
1. Robinhood’s real-time stock price update makes me more anxious when following stock prices. 
2. The coloring and loss/gain percentages gives me dopamine rush, which triggers me to unconsciously open up the app every few minutes throughout the day. 
3. The swipe-up to submit order design and the fun fair animations following it make the act of trading feels like a game. 
4. The red dot on the messages tab compelled me to click on it.
These are all typical ways of making an addictive game. I wonder if frequencies of trading is a KPI that Robinhood is designed to maximize, since it profits from feeding retail investors’ trades to the market-makers.

Anyway, I will move my portfolio to a boring broker to keep my sanity.
Hope this post helps you to be aware of the manipulation that Robinhood app is applying to us.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ixv3zg/why_robinhood_may_cause_you_to_lose_money/
47,The real reason to invest in Palantir,Ironleg01,1600805035,"I won't bore you with numbers, stats and all that shit.  Who cares anyway. As sophisticated investor the only thing I care about is how many LotR themed companies has company's CEO managed. As per my extensive research it is obvious that Thiel's new company will be the next meme stock surpassing Tesla and will usher in the greatest LotR memes trend we have ever seen.


&gt; Palantir: Since 2004 Thiel’s Palantir has been building big data products use in a wide range of industries, from law enforcement to disease response. This company, with its $1 billion in venture capital, according to Crunchbase, was named after magical “seeing stones” that functioned as communication devices across great distances.


&gt; Rivendell One LLC: Little is known about this company, first discovered, along with Lembas in 2012 in an SEC document when Thiel sold most his shares in Facebook. Considering that Thiel was the first outside investor in Facebook way back in 2004, that makes both of these companies among the oldest of the five. Rivendell is an Elven outpost in Tolkien’s fictional Middle-Earth.


&gt; Lembas LLC: The second of two companies Thiel used to invest in Facebook, this investment firm was named after a tasty Elven bread, a bite of which is capable of sating one’s appetite.


&gt; Valar Ventures: Founded in 2010, according to Crunchbase, this venture capital firm, which has raised $100 million and focuses on global companies, most recently the Number26 round announced today. Valar were 15 ancient spirits or gods who lived in Tolkien’s mythical universe.


&gt; Mithril Capital Management: Based in San Francisco, this investment firm with $540 million in funds, was founded in 2012 to specialize in large-scale economics in financial sectors. Mithril is the lightweight metal stronger than steal which was fashioned to create the main character of the Hobbit, Bilbo’s chain mail vest.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ixv3y3/the_real_reason_to_invest_in_palantir/

The stimulus would have to be passed two days before October first to get through the executive branch and get presidential signature. By federal law, Airlines would have to decide whether they are firing furloughed workers or keeping them. They will most likely 96% not keep them if they don’t get a stimulus or aren’t included in the stimulus because they need a $25 billion dollar bailout. This will most definitely cause the economy to tank along with the looming upcoming government shutdown because congress can’t decide on preventing federal government shutdown measures. This is important because you absolutely do not want the airlines industry to go haywire regardless of how menial it is because our country depends on the airlines industry and it’s like a domino effect on the rest of the economy.


it was assumed that by 30 September, the virus would be under control, and demand for air travel would have returned. That is obviously not the case.” There would be at least 40,000 less people working if the airlines fire workers on October 1st.

That being said, Only American Airlines expects approximately 19,000 employees to be involuntarily furloughed or separated from the company. Nevertheless, American Airlines still assumes that there could be an extension of the PSP. Recently, airlines and crew unions have been pushing for a CARES Act 2.0.

73,RKT$ Post-Hype Sleeper,FF_Fiend,1600803329,"I am not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice.



Hey WSB,



Here is my first attempt at DD. This is a play that I have gone full send on. I’m going to spare you the most of the financial and technical bullshit, because frankly I don’t know it.



1. RKT was hyped up like crazy.


For a solid 3 weeks prior to earnings every other post on this subreddit was about RKT. Every day the daily thread would be filled to the brim with rocket emojis. Some hyphy tards even made their own fanboy subreddit. RKT was a “meme stock” that briefly took over this subreddit like many have done before and many will do in the future.



2. RKT failed to live up to expectations.


WSB was calling for a price of 40$, 50$ 60$+ after earnings. Hype was at an all-time high and earnings report was around the corner. RKT had previously released the earnings numbers and everyone knew they would beat… Earnings are who we thought they were and if you want to crown the RKT bears, then crown their ass. Looking back, it was pretty obvious that the PRE-RELEASED earnings beat was PRICED IN. This fall was compounded with unfortunate timing as the market as a whole started to take a big step back the day after RKT’s earnings.



3. Post-Hype RKT


After the earnings report the stock plummeted and the bears took a victory lap. The billion dollar, well established, industry leader in mortgage origination was cast aside as trash, landing right next to a boxed mattress company in the WSB rejects pile.



4. RKT will absolutely demolish earning again.


I work in the mortgage origination industry. The market for mortgage origination right now is on fire. I have co-workers who have been in the industry for decades and who claim they have never seen demand like this. The company I work for has been around roughly twenty years and broke its previous record for ANNUAL revenue in July. Month over month we are setting origination records for our local branch, and then beating the new record the following month.


I can only imagine what this current mortgage origination market is like for a company like RKT with the an established brand and infrastructure to handle this level of demand. RKT has streamlined the mortgage process and that is the companies strongest asset. They are so much easier and close loans much more quickly than the competition. Q2 was fantastic, and Q3 will be more of the same, if not even stronger.



5. How I am playing this


Other than a few random ETSY calls RKT is my entire portfolio. I am buying as many of the 11/20 27$, 28$, 29$ calls I can afford. I am very bullish on the company long term, so I am also averaging down buying stock on when it dips, which I plan on holding for a couple years.


Earnings report is expected on 11/12. Here are my plays for 3 scenarios:


If they pre-release earnings and there is a run up prior to the report, I am selling all my calls before earnings.


If they do not pre-release earnings and there is a run up, I will sell half and hold half.


If they do not pre-release earnings and there is no run up, I will diamond hand the fuck out of my calls



TLDR: RKT go up, RKT go down, RKT go back up again before next earnings report. Buy calls, any $ for 11/20.",wallstreetbets,False,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ixujnt/rkt_posthype_sleeper/
74,my dd on the container store ticker tcs i ma buying more as I am posting this post,AdNo5629,1600803316,"The Container Store’s stock price, which traded below $2 during the widespread stay-at-home orders in April and March, is up more than 60% since Sept. 9 when the series debuted. Shares closed Monday at $6.58 a share, up 53 cents, or 8.8%.

The Netflix ( NFLX ) original series also features Retta, Rachel Zoe, Khloe Kardashian, Neil Patrick Harris and Eva Longoria. The 45-minute shows also feature non-celebrity families.

&amp;#x200B;

The Home Edit is hitting a chord with readers, too. Even in a crowded field of recently published political blockbusters , the professional organizers' book The Home Edit was No. 14 on Amazon’s top 20 sold last week and No. 7 on last week’s New York Times ( NYT 

) best seller list of advice and how-to books.

&amp;#x200B;

The pair of Nashville-based professional organizers have come up with their own spin on nesting and culling of cabinets and closets that’s different from Marie Kondo’s ideas. Her series, Tidying Up with Marie Kondo, also debuted on Netflix ( NFLX 

) in January 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

There was no brand tie-up with Kondo. Still, that show helped drive a 7.8% same-store sales increase in the first quarter of 2019, Container Store ( TCS ) CEO Melissa Reiff said in July when the company reported results. While the retailer has told Wall Street about its partnership with The Home Edit, it hasn’t disclosed expectations for the brand.

&amp;#x200B;

Where Kondo’s main premise is to get rid of things, Shearer and Teplin are more aligned with The Container Store’s philosophy of practical storage that makes closets, baths, kitchens, office and garages function and look better.

However, earlier this year, The company I used to work for got sued in lawsuit for fraud. Not only did I lose my job but also a lot of money as I owned some shares of the company. We were on the verge of going broke just a couple months later. 

&amp;#x200B;

After getting suggestions from some people and a little bit of research, I decided to start trading. I had been interested in the stock market for quite some time but I didn't know anything about it. 

I searched for some sources and found some good books and websites. I spent a lot of time reading up on material. I asked for some advice on social media and people were really welcoming.

&amp;#x200B;

Initially, I started with small amounts like 200$ and worked my way up from there. It was very inconsistent at first, I won't lie. I'd make profit one day, only to lose it the next. But, I was slowly getting better.

&amp;#x200B;

As of today, I have made nearly $21k in the last few months. I Made a good majority of by being a 'gay bear' the past few days.  Might Seem like easy money but it was the result of months of hard work. You can't overlook the amount of knowledge it takes to make money in the stock market.

&amp;#x200B;

Another important thing is to be disciplined and not risk all of the money you have. Start with an amount that is reasonable for your budget and financial situation, no matter how small. Too big of an amount and you are essentially gambling.

Hank Hill and associates

There are a few core elements of this trade. One is the potential for propane usage due to outdoor heaters for restaurants, schools, and residential users. 

These are the others.

NOAA says, “La Niña is here!” This means a colder, wetter winter than normal in the North, where Suburban Propane (SPH) has its highest density of locations.

This hurricane season has already broken records and currently stands as the second busiest season in history. We’re only a couple hurricanes from it being the busiest in history. When the power is out, people use propane.
Wildfires are ravaging the West Coast, causing massive power outages.

A Derecho (inland hurricane) hit Iowa last month, causing massive damage and power outages.

Many of the generators being used in disaster areas, use propane. (Think Generac)
This summer, the U.S. experienced a massive surge in sales of RVs, propane grills and camp stoves, generators, and a number of other propane appliances.

More people are working from home, meaning that of the people who do use propane, many are using it more, or will be using it more than they typically do, this winter.

Farmers are using record amounts of propane for agricultural purposes.

All these factors combine to make a whirlwind of a propane trade. SPH is the second largest supplier of propane in the U.S. and is the best positioned to benefit from this surge. Suburban Propane is the best disaster trade of 2020!

I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, elon, you're so much more than gorgeous
So much more than perfect 
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me tendies, I can work on it
Give me some dipping sauce while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, elon, I don't blame you
Teslas in rotation, you're waitin' for me
Look at my portfolio, when I dip my tendies
'Cause we only get one tendy a week
That's why you autists always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never ask elon for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when my options expire
None of my wife's boyfriends is jealous of me
Nobody losing tendies as much as I be
That's why elon text me and tell me he love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my tendies and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, he open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love him, he love me. I know that I'm no one my family wants me to be. Just a young autist, out in these streets.

58,"Someone gave me the idea of a Jpow fanfic. Plz forgive errors, im retard",angrypenguin15,1600798216,"Jerome Powell awoke bright and early at 5 am on one of the fed's notorious ""Casual Friday!"" Today, Jpow seemed to have an unusual bounce in his step, one of glee. He thinks to himself,

""I need to get ready for work. Today is a special day!"" 

He stops in his tracks to think and with a new-found enthusiasm, he got ready for work.

“Today is a special day,” Jpow mutters under his breath.

“Today is a special day. Today is a special day.” Repeating over and over as if addicted to the phrase. Jpow flicks on his closet light, revealing a quite seducing gray suit collection. He steps foot into his closet admiring his suit collection.

“Today is a special day.” He repeats.

Jpow proceeds to the end of the clothesline within his closet, making sure to take time and admire each suit as he walks past. He looks at the last suit and smirks. He suddenly pulls back the last suit to reveal a tailored light blue polo next to a tailored and well-kept pair of khakis. Jpow dawns his polo shirt, which perfectly accentuates his seemingly lost features. Defined shoulder, flat stomach, broad chest, this shirt was fitting just right and Jpow could feel it.

“Today is a special day.” He mutters again.

Jpow proceeds to put on the tailored pants, they seemed to fit everywhere except the groin where it seemed as if it was two sizes too small. His massive cock was clearly outlined through his pants, but he did not care. He knew people would see, he wanted people too.

Jpow walks into his bathroom and stands in front of his mirror and examines himself.

A grin takes over Jpow's face as he mutters, ""Jpow is ready for the day."" 

He proceeds downstairs and is met by his wife, who awoke before him, gives him his cup of coffee before he leaves.

“I love you, honey.” She says, kissing him on the cheek. Jpow stares off into nothing. With a thousand-yard stare, the only words 
Jpow seems to be able muster is,

""Today is a special day,"" as he makes a callus exit of his home.

Jpow arrives at the fed’s office. Jpow takes the elevator up to his office floor but is met with pure chaos. Jpow steps out of the elevator and starts strutting his way to his office. The cubicles he passes are chaotic. Accountants screaming “I thought stonks can *only* go up!”,  “I said buy *low* sell *high* retard!” and “OH NO, Bulls *can’t* be fuck!” are heard echoing through the office as Jpow proceeds down the cubicle halls. Yet Jpow is unshaken and takes no notice for today is *the* special day. Jpow stops in front of his door and locks eyes with his shiny gold nameplate nearing chest level on the door. Etched into the gold is “Jerome Powell”. Before entering the room Jpow takes in a deep breath, and exhales while saying

“today is a special day.” 

Jpow opens the solid oak door revealing a massive grey room. Grey fabric walls align the entire space, with a tight nit grey carpet to match. The room seemed to be empty except for one item set right in the center of it, a printer. 
Jpow closes the door behind him. Screams from his accountants can still be heard even through such a heavy door and padded walls. His eyes suddenly grew mad, veins started to bulge from his forehead. The khakis get tighter with Jpow’s every heartbeat. Jpow was horny for the printer.  

“Brrrrrrrrrr,” the printer says as Jpow undresses. 

""Oh, we *both* know you’re a whore.” He says while undoing his belt.

“Brrrrrrrrrr”

“Shut up! I’m going to make your print whether you like it or not.”

“Brrrrrrrrrr”

Jpows stands face to face with the printer, and fully naked sporting a throbbing hard 8-inch hog. He proceeds to thrust his cock into the paper receiver of the printer. 

“BRRRRRRRRRRRRRR” 

Every light on the printer starts to flicker as Jpow. The printed page tray is going in and out at a break-neck pace.

“BRRRRRRRRR, BRRRRRRRRRRRRRR” 

“oh fuck!” he says as he thrusts with no sign of relent.

“BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR”

The once screams from his accounts start to sound more glee full. Screams of “Bears are fuk!” and “Eat shit Trevor Milton!” can now be heard in the room.

“BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR” screams the printer

“I’m Cumming!” Jpow says as he makes one final thrust.

Jpow erupts. The cum fills the paper tray of the printer. It nears full when he pulls his now soft cock out of the paper holder and closes the cum filled tray on the printer.

“That should fill you up for a while, now print more. Papa needs some more tendies.” A sweaty Jpow says while putting his clothes on.

“Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, Brrrrrrrrrr, Brrrrrr”

“You better keep your mouth shut if you know what’s good for you,” Jpow says angrily.

“I better not see any red till next week, you go that?!” he says threateningly. 

Jpow flips the light switch, leaving the windowless room in pure darkness. He slams the solid oak door closed.

Jpow walks away from the office. A faint “brrrrrrrr” can be heard thinning out as he walks further and further down the hall only to be met with praise from accountants. He takes a deep breath in and exhales with relief.

90,A retelling of an old story that seems highly relevant to this sub.,Call911iDareYou,1600760682,"John has been working at a luxury car dealership for the past 15 years. He was just recently promoted to general manager of the dealership. John was finally starting to feel like he had really made it in life. At the age of 35, John had a great job that paid well, he had a new luxury car, he owned a house in a nice neighborhood, he was still close with his old friends and his parents, and he had a beautiful girlfriend he was planning to propose to on the trip to France they were planning the next year.

Seemingly out of nowhere, John woke up one day feeling completely unfulfilled, but he couldn't understand why. Johns drive to work now entailed him constantly finding faults with the luxury car he just bought. He started taking notice of other cars on the road that were better than his. He started dreading going to work, feeling like he was working too hard for too little money. John began thinking of arguments to have with the dealership owner over petty things that bugged him. John's dissatisfaction carried over to his home as well. He picked up a hobby of browsing listings for houses that were drastically out of his price range, and would often drive through more expensive neighborhoods to look at houses in his free time. John started to take notice of other women as well.About a month after this change of demeanor, John starts to hear a voice in his head. 

""Break up with your girlfriend,"" it says. 

John ignores the voice and tries to continue on living the life he created for himself; he had been planning to propose to her after all. The voice didn't stop though. Every second John wasn't thinking about his car, his work, or his house, the voice repeated endlessly, 

""Break up with your girlfriend."" 

After a few weeks, John gives in, and breaks up with his girlfriend. The voice gives him only a short break before it changes its tune. On his way to work the next week, the voice beckons John, 

""You need to quit your job."" 

Beginning to worry about his mental health, John visits a doctor and explains the situation, but his concerns are dismissed as regular thoughts.

John tried to hold out as long as he could, but every day the voice in his head's tone grew more aggressive than the last. After two weeks the voice was constantly shouting at him, 

""YOU NEED TO QUIT YOUR JOB, JOHN!"" 

He caved, and told his boss he was quitting as soon as he showed up to work. John's ride home was silent, he felt he could finally relax. That was, until he pulled up to his house. That was when the voice came back, calling to John, 

""You need to sell the house."" 

John had a gut feeling about what was to come, and started to drive off to spend the night in a hotel when he heard a rattle come from the car as he went over a speed bump. The voice immediately changes its inflection and mantra, 

""YOU NEED TO SELL THE HOUSE AND THE CAR AND GO TO VEGAS! THERE IS NOTHING LEFT FOR YOU HERE."" 

John was broken within minutes. He called a quick-sale realtor to come by the house that day, he called the salvation army to donate everything in his house, and he drove to the nearest car lot to take the first offer given on his vehicle. John takes a taxi to the airport immediately after all the paperwork is finalized. He gets what feels like the best sleep he's had in years while sitting on a bench in the terminal. The voice in John's head wakes him up in the morning, directing John to buy a ticket for the 3:15 flight to Las Vegas on Delta, flight DL8522. John looks at the flight status board and sure enough, the flight is there. He books the flight which amazingly departs and lands perfectly on time. Once he walks off the airplane the voice calls out,

""Go to the Luxor Casino, find Adam, the manager of the high stakes floor, and have him lead you to the tellers to do a bank transfer. Ask to be assisted by Amy.""

John feels uneasy, but is now gaining confidence in the voice as it seems to know things before he does. He goes to the Luxor Casino and finds Adam at the high stakes floor. Adam directs John to the tellers, where he asks for Amy. Once Amy comes out, John is immediately attracted to her and actually hits it off with her. He gets Amy's number as he's gathering all of his chips and starts to feel like the voice has a plan for him and is setting him up for a better life. 

""Go to roulette table #3, wait 3 spins, then bet it all straight up on 3,"" the voice says.

John goes to table #3 and watches the first 3 spins, which come out 0, 1, then 2. John, viewing this as all the confirmation he needs, is filled with excitement and confidence; he is imagining his future from this day forward. He puts all $400,000 to his name on 3 and waits for the next spin. Everyone around him is clamoring with excitement, some follow his lead and pile on the bets on 3. The dealer calls the end of the betting and spins the wheel. The whole floor goes quiet as the silence emanating from table #3 overtakes the room. The ball, seeming to take forever to stop rolling, finally drops in and bounces, landing on 35. John, still trying to grasp what is going on, listens for the voice that's taken control of his life over the past month. The silence in his head and in the room is palpable. After a few seconds, the voice cries out,

Take 20M x 20K(consider very low per vehicle)

T$LA expect its energy sector to be similar or even bigger than its EV market. So another 400B? 

Total 400B x2 = 800B 
Take a reasonable Price to sale ratio of 4:
800B x4 = 3.2Trillion in market cap?

12,My long term investment strategy,hotfudgedrizzle,1600754306,"Longtime luker here. I have been mulling this over for quite some time now. And I think I have gained more trust than ever in my ability to predict the future. Now hear me out slime.

Global warming is humanity's greatest existential threat to date. (Right after Nukes) With global temperatures raising across the board. Droughts will become a constant fixture in our lives. People living in areas with already poor access to clean water will migrate towards more temperate climates e.g Africa to Europe. Creating a battle for what is to become Earths most precious resource. 

CLEAN WATER 

These Water Wars are most likely to become the next World War.                                                                 (Even the acronym works out. Like common guys)

If at this point in time you cant hear the Military Industrial Complex smacking its lips at the thought of the worlds defense departments shelling out a combined sum of Trillions to gain whatever advantage over the worlds to be scarce clean water sources. I SURE CAN.  

This is why, as soon as daddy's hedge fund manager hands over the keys to the estate, I shall be investing heavily in DEFENCE CONTRACTORS.     

Once I am sure that I am maximizing my profits by selling, and I can hear the sweet sweet sound of the cash machine going brrrrrr.

25,A hypothetical put on NKLA,okinshade,1600751261,"Hey guys,

I just want to make sure my math is correct on this. If you were to spent $10,000 to purchase a put on NKLA on 9/8 and sold it today, profit from the trade would be $49,455 or $39,410? Here’s the scenario:

9/8 price $54 

(Strike) $44 - (current price) $27 - (current option premium) $2.87 = ($14.13 x 100) x 35 = $49,455 

But then I’d need to subtract the initial $10,045 to equal $39,410.

Disclosure: This is based in mere speculation.

How is it possible that one day before one of the biggest events of the season for Tesla, an email from the CEO of the company is leaked, causing the stock to go down? I feel like there’s a big mastermind behind this, and  we’ve been played. Wouldn’t it be extremely beneficial for those In a position of power to leak an email from a company, in order to buy options at a lower price? Let me say this, yes it sounds awfully retarded once again, but there’re actual studies from the university of Columbia that concludes that CEOs have been taking advantage of the knowledge from upcoming option grants, and they’ve been using this information to lower the stock price, and buy those juicy options at a batter price. If they have already done something like this, why not “leaked an email” and take advantage of the disorder to make huge profits.

8,"[P] Data Science Pull Requests – Review &amp; merge code, data, and experiments",PhYsIcS-GUY227,1601492322,"**TL;DR**

Hi r/MachineLearning, I'm one of the creators of [DAGsHub](https://dagshub.com/). Today we are launching **Data Science Pull Requests (DS PRs)** – expanding Pull Requests (PRs) to include **data**, **models,** and **experiments**. The idea behind DS PRs is to automate the data science review process and enable Open Source Data Science.

I've written about why we built DS PRs and how they work ([https://dagshub.com/blog/data-science-pull-requests/](https://dagshub.com/blog/data-science-pull-requests/)), but I thought I'd share a bit more here, and maybe get a discussion going as well.

\---

**Motivation:**

* If you've ever worked on a data science project with other people or tried reviewing someone else's data science work, you know how hard it is to get the information you need in order to understand someone else's work or explain your own so that the review process is meaningful. A review is often reduced to looking at a few token components/metrics, or the process is slow and manual because systems are not built for review.  
 
* **Open Source Data Science (OSDS):**  
Open Source Data Science (OSDS) has the potential to have a similar effect on the world, as Open Source Software (OSS) did.  
But let's face it – Open Source Data Science doesn't *really* exist. If you maintain some OSDS project and you want to accept contributions from people (like you would for OSS) – you have to do it almost entirely manually, or ***resort to accepting only code changes*** (no way to accept data bug fixes – and we all know there are plenty).  
From the other side, if you want to improve your ML portfolio by contributing to some OSDS project, you're also stuck. You have to either fork the project and not contribute your changes (which means their quality is never reviewed – you don't learn as much) or go through a painstaking manual effort (Kaggle is worth a mention here, as DS use it to show their chops. However, it is competitive by nature. We want to encourage interoperability and cooperation as much as possible).

**What are data science pull requests (DS PRs):**

DS PRs are a method and a tool that expands pull requests (PRs) for data science and ML needs. PRs are all about comparing and accepting changes to code. With DS PRs you can do the same for your data, models, and experiments.

Concretely this means:

* ***Review, compare, and comment on your experiments*** (metrics, parameters, visualizations), in the **context** of your PR.
* ***See what data and models have changed*** (not just code)
* ***Compare and diff notebooks***
* After reviewing the DS PR, you can merge it in, which ***merges code, data, and models all at once***.

Learning to use Data Science PRs is very straightforward, read more here: [https://dagshub.com/docs/collaborating\_on\_dagshub/data\_science\_pull\_requests/](https://dagshub.com/docs/collaborating_on_dagshub/data_science_pull_requests/)

**Next steps:**

There is a lot of work to be done, and many things to be improved. I really want to make this workflow as simple and effective for everyone, and your input would be greatly appreciated.

**Feedback:**

I'd like to ask for your feedback on how DS PRs could be improved for the community. It would also be great to hear how everyone manages collaboration and data science review today.

19,"[P] Tribuo, an enterprise ML library in Java",craigacp,1601482844,"Our group in [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com) recently open sourced [Tribuo](https://tribuo.org) an Apache 2.0 licensed Java library for Machine Learning on [Github](https://github.com/oracle/tribuo). Our goal with Tribuo is to make it easy to build and deploy ML models on the JVM, while making it more idiomatic for Java developers by having a strong static type system. Our models expect objects as inputs and produce objects as outputs (not tensors or float arrays), and the models control their feature and output domains, meaning they can check if a given input is outside of the training domain, and the outputs are typed based on what kind of prediction is being made (e.g. classification, regression, clustering).

As we've got a fully object oriented input and output pipeline this means that Tribuo models record all their input properties (e.g. the location of the input data, the hash of the input file, any data splits or feature transformations), along with all the training hyperparameters. This means any Tribuo model is completely self describing and replicable, so you can use any model to produce a configuration which lets you rebuild that model from scratch (even including the RNG states). Similarly the evaluations record the model and test data provenance, and the datasets themselves record the data provenance.

We also provide interfaces to TensorFlow, ONNX Runtime, XGBoost and other ML libraries available on the JVM. You can train models in TensorFlow &amp; XGBoost (along with the other interfaces) through Tribuo gaining all of the benefit's of Tribuo's tracking and type systems, and also convert TensorFlow, ONNX and XGBoost models into Tribuo models to get the type safety and checking. Our ONNX support is particularly useful because it allows the JVM deployment of models trained in Python libraries like scikit-learn and pytorch.

We've been using Tribuo internally in production in Oracle for the past few years, and we're excited to share it with the community.

31,[R] Sparse GPU Kernels for Deep Learning,tgale13,1601472310,"**Abstract:**

Scientific workloads have traditionally exploited high levels of sparsity to accelerate computation and reduce memory requirements. While deep neural networks can be made sparse, achieving practical speedups on GPUs is difficult because these applications have relatively moderate levels of sparsity that are not sufficient for existing sparse kernels to outperform their dense counterparts. In this work, we study sparse matrices from deep learning applications and identify favorable properties that can be exploited to accelerate computation. Based on these insights, we develop high-performance GPU kernels for two sparse matrix operations widely applicable in neural networks: sparse matrix-dense matrix multiplication and sampled dense-dense matrix multiplication. Our kernels reach 27% of single-precision peak on Nvidia V100 GPUs. Using our kernels, we demonstrate sparse Transformer and MobileNet models that achieve 1.2-2.1x speedups and up to 12.8x memory savings without sacrificing accuracy.

&amp;#x200B;

As part of my work, I'm building a transformer model for a non NLP task. I can prototype it on my RTX2060, but one epoch training takes 1 month. So I asked our backend software engineer to have a more powerful GPU in the cloud. We are a small startup and we don't have a big budget for this kind of stuff, but months ago I managed to obtain $25k in Azure credits and I wanted to burn those first rather than our real money. Unfortunately Azure does not increase our quota of GPUs beyond the K80s unless we actually go on a pay per use plan. I ran a test and found out that one epoch on a K80 was taking 9 months, x9 slower than my laptop's small GPU (of which I can only use half memory, by the way). I reported this but the software engineer crossed his arms behind his head and said we have no chance to get anything more than that from Azure free credits. He went on telling me that ""in the meantime I might enjoy reading a couple of medium articles on how to train a pytorch model on multiple nodes"". I replied sharp that I can use pytorch-lightning to do multi-gpu training in case I really need it. I asked him to please call Azure support and play the last card of asking by voice a small quota increase. He refused to do so and asked me again why I don't consider doing multi-GPU training on K80s. I explained why transformer models train faster in tensor-core powered GPUs. He looked at me with disbelief and asked me arrogantly: then how come VGG was trained on K80s? Current year is 2020.

66,[R] Current Time Series Anomaly Detection Benchmarks are Flawed and are Creating the Illusion of Progress.,eamonnkeogh,1601429559,"Dear Colleagues.

I would not normally broadcast a non-reviewed paper. However, the contents of this paper may be of timely interest to anyone working on Time Series Anomaly Detection (and based on current trends, that is about 20 to 50 labs worldwide).

In brief, we believe that most of the commonly used time series anomaly detection benchmarks, including Yahoo, Numenta, NASA, OMNI-SDM etc., suffer for one or more of four flaws. And, because of these flaws, we cannot draw *any* meaningful conclusions from papers that test on them. 

This is a surprising claim, but I hope you will agree that we have provided forceful evidence \[a\].

So things like categorical\_features and monotic\_attributes are not available.

82,[D] Why deploying ML models is hard,bendee983,1601409763,"Chip Huyen posted a very interesting Twitter thread on the challenges of deploying ML models and how the process differs from tinkering with ML algos in your development environment.

Key points:

1 - Deploying a model for friends to play with is easy. Deploying it reliably is hard. Serving 1000s of requests with ms latency is hard. Keeping it up all the time is hard.

2 - ML models perform best right after training. In prod, ML systems degrade quickly bc of concept drift.

3- MLOps isn’t an exemption. For online ML systems, you want to update them as fast as humanly possible.

4- Deploying ML systems isn't just about getting ML systems to the end-users.  It's about building an infrastructure so the team can be quickly alerted when something goes wrong, figure out what went wrong, test in production, roll-out/rollback updates.

Abstract

This paper presents a basic machine learning algorithm, named Dendrite Net or DD, just like Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). DD's main concept is that the algorithm can recognize this class after learning, if the output's logical expression contains the corresponding class's logical relationship among inputs (and∖or∖not). Experiments and results: DD, the first white-box machine learning algorithm, showed excellent system identification performance for the black-box system. Secondly, it was verified by nine real-world applications that DD brought better generalization capability relative to MLP architecture that imitated neurons' cell body (Cell body Net) for regression. Thirdly, by MINIST and FASHION-MINIST datasets, it was verified that DD showed higher testing accuracy under greater training loss than Cell body Net for classification. The number of modules can effectively adjust DD's logical expression capacity, which avoids over-fitting and makes it easy to get a model with outstanding generalization capability. Finally, repeated experiments in MATLAB and PyTorch (Python) demonstrated that DD was faster than Cell body Net both in epoch and forward-propagation. We highlight DD's white-box attribute, controllable precision for better generalization capability, and lower computational complexity. Not only can DD be used for generalized engineering, but DD has vast development potential as a module for deep learning.

This paper presents a  study focused on the scoring of sleeping EEG signals to measure if the increase of the pressure on the features due to a reduction of the number though different techniques results in a benefit. The work also  studies the convenience of increasing the number of input signals in order to allow the network to extract better features.

We propose Parametric UMAP, a parametric variation of the UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) algorithm. UMAP is a non-parametric graph-based dimensionality reduction algorithm using applied Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology to find low-dimensional embeddings of structured data. The UMAP algorithm consists of two steps: (1) Compute a graphical representation of a dataset (fuzzy simplicial complex), and (2) Through stochastic gradient descent, optimize a low-dimensional embedding of the graph. Here, we replace the second step of UMAP with a deep neural network that learns a parametric relationship between data and embedding. We demonstrate that our method performs similarly to its non-parametric counterpart while conferring the benefit of a learned parametric mapping (e.g. fast online embeddings for new data). We then show that UMAP loss can be extended to arbitrary deep learning applications, for example constraining the latent distribution of autoencoders, and improving classifier accuracy for semi-supervised learning by capturing structure in unlabeled data.

Furthermore, sometimes, I want to change a small things and re-fit my model or use some other model and I find myself searching where to change that and hence lose much time in the process. 

Therefore, I started a project that will automate all these things and allow me to fit, evaluate, test, compare and play with models using just a yaml or json file, where I need to configure or just describe what I want to do.

The idea was exciting (at least to me) and I spent two weeks non stop writing code everyday. I recently released a stable version with a great support for all sklearn models, cross validation, data preprocessing and much more.

9,[D] The vicious circle in feature selection,candalfigomoro,1601390363,"Suppose you have a very high number of features. Training models and tuning hyper-parameters with a very high number of features can be very time expensive. So you try to perform some feature selection in advance.

If you use another model to perform feature selection (e.g. you use another model through something like sklearn's SelectFromModel or Boruta), I think that we have another problem.

The problem is that feature selection performed by that model is only as good as that model itself. If the model used for feature selection is not good (i.e. it overfits or underfits), I will feed my downstream model with features selected by a poor feature selection model. Basically, for feature selection I can't trust anything weaker than my best model. So what should I do? If I try to tune the hyper-parameters of the model used for feature selection, I return to the starting situation where training/tuning my model with all the features is too much time expensive. Moreover, optimal hyper-parameters can be different when I add/remove features.

If you try to use some other feature selection method such as filter methods with correlation, it could be that your simple correlation-based method is unable to capture interactions that your more powerful downstream model would have used.

I think this is a vicious circle. What do you think about this? Do you trust feature selection performed through non-tuned models (potentially weaker than your downstream models)?",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/j20gsx/d_the_vicious_circle_in_feature_selection/

While TextureGAN only uses a small texture patch, I am interested in finding similar projects that keep semantic structures of a larger input image, applying that to the line art.

14,[D] Issues with Wake-Sleep algorithm in bio-inspired RNN,Optrode,1601387413,"I've been training a new image recognition / speech recognition model (with plans to add text generation and speech synthesis a few months down the line), and I've run into some issues with the training algorithm 
(Wake-Sleep) as well as energy consumption during training. 

Part of the issue is that it's a stateful recurrent model with a kind of finicky architecture (I'm doing architecture search using an evolutionary algorithm, with the layer connectivity graph specified by a relatively flexible 2-bit dynamic programming scheme that encodes strong Bayesian priors in the connectivity patterns between modules) that exploits nonlinear behavior of the computing substrate, which results in the model suffering severe numerical instability unless the CPU temperature remains relatively constant. So I've been training the model continuously for the past 4 months. Energy consumption has become problematic. The hardware this model runs on is relatively energy efficient, since it runs at very low clock speeds thanks to massive pallalelization of the workload, but it's a fairly big model (approximately 10^14 weights and around 10^11 biases) and that shit adds up. 

The issue I'm having is that this implementation of the stochastic wake-sleep algorithm has ""sleep"" and ""wake"" phases at variable intervals controlled by the model's internal dynamics, and recently, instead of converging on a stable limit cycle, it's been exhibiting chaotic / unstable behavior, failing to cycle correctly between the two training phases. I know this issue wouldn't arise with a more conventional training algorithm, but this version of Wake-Sleep has some really desirable properties, such as being really good at zero-shot learning, due to using an adaptation of the EM algorithm (Riemann EM) during the ""sleep"" phase that ensures that weight updates preferentially strengthen the representation of unfamiliar samples that were presented during the ""wake"" epoch. I've tried to induce reliable periodicity by varying the composition of the input batches, selecting progressively lower entropy inputs as the elapsed time since the last ""sleep"" phase increases, but so far that isn't working. I know some of you are going to say that messing around with weird model architectures and optimization procedures isn't worth it, and I should just be pulling the plug and training something simple and interpretable like GPT5, but this thing has kinda grown on me, and I don't think I could bear to axe it (and I don't think my collaborator would be on board either).

15,[D] Continual Learning for regression problem with continual data stream,MLstudent94,1601387366,"Hello reddit,

I am currently searching a suitable ML-algorithm dealing with a supervised regression problem with a continual data stream.

Task: The goal is to estimate the power of a machine based on round about 100 input values. These input values are numerical and few are binary (one hot encoded). There already exists a big set of training data and models that estimate the regression problem really good.

Now it happens, that the task of the underlying machine changes, so the future incoming input data is not represented by the previous trainingdata anymore. Therefore I am looking for a suitable algorithm to online learn the system with the incoming data stream(supervised).

The kind of the underlying algorithm is free to choose. Also it doesnt matter if the system is learned incrementaly or in batches.

Not sure how to exactly frame the question or if it's even appropriate for this sub, but I'm hoping that there would be people in similar situations who could offer some insight.

I'm currently a master's student in my third semester doing research. I'm fortunate  to be surrounded by many smart and hard-working people to learn from and work with. One thing that I've noticed, though, is that many of them seem to really have fun when they do things like read research papers. One of my lab mates has even said that they ""stay up until 5 a.m. because the new proceedings was so fun and interesting.""

I've never felt this type of joy when reading papers before. Ever. And I'm wondering if that's a problem or if that means that research life isn't for me.

I usually get to the lab at 8:30 to 9 a.m. I work for a good 8-9 hours everyday and usually go home after that to either chill or do some personal work. I sometimes work on holidays and weekends too, but nothing too overboard (maaaaybe a few hours if I'm productive).

When I read papers or listen to lectures/talks, it _sometimes_ is ""fun"" because I'm really curious about the results or findings of the authors. But even in this case I just read or skim through the abstract/intro/conclusion and write it down somewhere (usually a Google Spreadsheet). I've never once felt this burning urge to sacrifice sleep or my personal life to read papers.

22,[Project] How To: Ditching Ubuntu in favor of Arch Linux for a Deep Learning Workstation,Guestros,1601382580,"Hey guys, I wrote about my experiences with Arch as a Deep Learning workstation on my blog, and I really love it compared to the ""classic"" Ubuntu setup. Curious about your thoughts, and the OS you are using!

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.datafortress.cloud/blog/howto-arch-linux-deeplearning-workstation/](https://www.datafortress.cloud/blog/howto-arch-linux-deeplearning-workstation/)

&amp;#x200B;

Abstract

## Why should I ditch Ubuntu?

Most of you might be using Ubuntu for their workstations, and that is fine for the more inexperienced users. One of the issues I had with Ubuntu and the Tensorflow/CUDA though, has been that handling the different drivers and versions of CUDA, cudnn, TensorFlow, and so on has been quite a struggle. I’m not sure about you, but once I had a working Tensorflow 1.15 or 2.0 environment, I usually did not touch it anymore being scared to mess up this holy configuration.

Working with different programs it would be nice to have a way of switching between the two most used TensorFlow versions of 1.15 and 2.0 like you can do with Google Colab in a single command, but installing a different TensorFlow version usually messed up my system again.

Additionally, Arch has always been on my To-Do list, as it is the most “barebone” Linux distro you can get, meaning you are working way closer on the hardware compared to “higher abstractions” like Ubuntu. In their own words, Ubuntu is built to “work out of the box and make the installation process as easy as possible for new users”, whilst the motto of Arch Linux is “customize everything”. Being way closer to the hardware Arch is insanely faster compared to Ubuntu (and miles ahead of Windows), for the cost of more Terminal usage.

When I have been using Arch in the past weeks, RAM usage usually halved compared to Ubuntu, and installing Machine Learning packages is a breeze. I can have both TensorFlow 1.15 and 2.0 working together, switching the versions with Anaconda environments. Also, the system works quite stable, as I am using the LTS (long term support) kernels of Linux, and usually updates to the famous AUR (user-made packages in Arch) are coming out a month ahead of the Debian (Ubuntu) packages.

All in all, I can only recommend setting up an Arch Linux Deep Learning station as it is:

1. Faster, like packages will install super fast, deep learning is supercharged, …
2. More stable
3. Easier to switch between TensorFlow versions compared to Ubuntu.

I will split the how-to in two parts, the first one being “How to I install Arch Linux” and the second one being “How to install the Deep Learning workstation packages”.

the author of the paper suggests to re-interpolate the time series and then perform DTW. Also, my time series have different endpoint so I can't see how to apply interpolation. Maybe to fix that I can pad zeros to the end of the shorter time series?

32,[D] Factors of successful ML(Ops) after 3+ years of ML in Production,benkoller,1601379693,"Recently I was invited to a conference to give a workshop about ""Machine Learning in Production"". Before the hands-on part, my Co-Founder and I talked a bit about the ""success factors"" we've determined for ourselves during the last years of doing production ML. It spawned a cool discussion, and it would be great to hear more opinions from the bigger community of [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning).

The common theme throughout all projects was always the reproducibility of trainings and the transparency of what work is being done throughout the team. Back then we had to spend quite some effort to build enough supportive tech around those issues, but it was definitely worth the efforts.

I've written it out into a more detailed blogpost ([https://blog.maiot.io/12-factors-of-ml-in-production/](https://blog.maiot.io/12-factors-of-ml-in-production/)), but this subreddit is always a great place to get some opinionated discussions going :).

Our key factors for successful and reproducible ""production ML"" are:

**1.** Versioning

* TL;DR: You need to version your code, and you need to version your data.

**2.** Explicit feature dependencies

* TL;DR: Make your feature dependencies explicit in your code.

**3.** Descriptive training and preprocessing

* TL;DR: Write readable code and separate code from the configuration.

**4.** Reproducibility of trainings

* TL;DR: Use pipelines and automation.

**5.** Testing

* TL;DR: Test your code, test your models.

**6.** Drift / Continuous training

* TL;DR: If your data can change run a continuous training pipeline.

**7.** Tracking of results

* TL;DR: Track results via automation.

**8.** Experimentation vs Production models

* TL;DR: Notebooks are not production-ready, so experiment in pipelines early on.

**9.** Training-Serving-Skew

* TL;DR: Correctly embed preprocessing to serving, and make sure you understand up- and downstream of your data.

**10.** Comparability

* TL;DR: Build your pipelines so you can easily compare training results across pipelines.

**11.** Monitoring

* TL;DR: Again: you build it, you run it. Monitoring models in production is a part of data science in production.

**12.** Deployability of Models

* TL;DR: Every training pipeline needs to produce a deployable artifact, not “just” a model.

KITTI is the ubiquitous standard for driving, and seems to use a public test set with private labels that are compared to those you upload. Unfortunately, submissions are only allowed for novel work and not implementations. I'm new to ML but how on earth is this kind of thing acceptable? Authors could be falsifying results, and even if you go all the way of reimplementing a paper with no code, it's still impossible to verify your results being close to the original? Yes, I understand the compromise is to split the train set into your own test/validation set, but this significantly affects results when the dataset is as small as 7000 frames. Let's say I set aside 2000 frames for validation. This reduces frames available for training by over 25%, which will undoubtedly lead to worse results than the original paper and make true reproducibility impossible.

Most of us in data science have seen a lot of AI-generated people in recent times, whether it be in papers, blogs, or videos. We’ve reached a stage where it’s becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between actual human faces and faces generated by artificial intelligence. However, with the current available machine learning toolkits, creating these images yourself is not as difficult as you might think. In my view, GANs will change the way we generate video games and special effects. Using this approach, we could create realistic textures or characters on demand.

So in this post, we’re going to look at the generative adversarial networks behind AI-generated images, and help you to understand how to create and build your own similar application with PyTorch. We’ll try to keep the post as intuitive as possible for those of you just starting out, but we’ll try not to dumb it down too much. At the end of this article, you’ll have a solid understanding of how General Adversarial Networks (GANs) work, and how to build your own.

Abstract:  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful to learn the representation of graph-structured data. Most of the GNNs use the message-passing scheme, where the embedding of a node is iteratively updated by aggregating the information of its neighbors. To achieve a better expressive capability of node influences, attention mechanism has grown to be popular to assign trainable weights to the nodes in aggregation. Though the attention-based GNNs have achieved remarkable results in various tasks, a clear understanding of their discriminative capacities is missing. In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of the representational properties of the GNN that adopts the attention mechanism as an aggregator. Our analysis determines all cases when those attention-based GNNs can always fail to distinguish certain distinct structures. Those cases appear due to the ignorance of cardinality information in attention-based aggregation. To improve the performance of attention-based GNNs, we propose cardinality preserved attention (CPA) models that can be applied to any kind of attention mechanisms. Our experiments on node and graph classification confirm our theoretical analysis and show the competitive performance of our CPA models.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/j1oer1/r_improving_attention_mechanism_in_graph_neural/

99,[D] Loading saved NER model back into HuggingFace pipeline?,martin1285,1601319763,"Hello,

I am doing some research into HuggingFace's functionalities for transfer learning (specifically, for named entity recognition). To preface, I am a bit new to transformer architectures. I briefly walked through their example off of their website:

    from transformers import pipeline
    
    nlp = pipeline(""ner"")
    
    sequence = ""Hugging Face Inc. is a company based in New York City. Its headquarters are in DUMBO, therefore very"" \
           ""close to the Manhattan Bridge which is visible from the window.""
    
    print(nlp(sequence))

What I would like to do is save and run this locally without having to download the ""ner"" model every time (which is over 1 GB in size). In their documentation, I see that you can save the pipeline using the ""pipeline.save\_pretrained()"" function to a local folder. The results of this are various files which I am storing into a specific folder.

My question would be how can I load this model back up into a script to continue classifying as in the example above after saving? The output of ""pipeline.save\_pretrained()"" is multiple files.

Here is what I have tried so far:

1: Following the documentation about pipeline

    pipe = transformers.TokenClassificationPipeline(model=""pytorch_model.bin"", tokenizer='tokenizer_config.json')
    

The error I got was: 'str' object has no attribute ""config""

2: Following HuggingFace example on ner:

    from transformers import AutoModelForTokenClassification, AutoTokenizer
    import torch
    
    model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(""path to folder following .save_pretrained()"")
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(""path to folder following .save_pretrained()"")
    
    label_list = [
    ""O"",       # Outside of a named entity
    ""B-MISC"",  # Beginning of a miscellaneous entity right after another miscellaneous entity
    ""I-MISC"",  # Miscellaneous entity
    ""B-PER"",   # Beginning of a person's name right after another person's name
    ""I-PER"",   # Person's name
    ""B-ORG"",   # Beginning of an organisation right after another organisation
    ""I-ORG"",   # Organisation
    ""B-LOC"",   # Beginning of a location right after another location
    ""I-LOC""    # Location
    ]
    
    sequence = ""Hugging Face Inc. is a company based in New York City. Its headquarters are in DUMBO, therefore very"" \
           ""close to the Manhattan Bridge.""
    
    # Bit of a hack to get the tokens with the special tokens
    tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(tokenizer.decode(tokenizer.encode(sequence)))
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(sequence, return_tensors=""pt"")
    
    outputs = model(inputs)[0]
    predictions = torch.argmax(outputs, dim=2)
    
    print([(token, label_list[prediction]) for token, prediction in zip(tokens, predictions[0].tolist())])

This yields an error: list index out of range

I also tried printing out just predictions which is not returning the text format of the tokens along with their entities.

Will AI inevitably develop a conscience, a sense of moral good and bad like humans? Is conscience an inevitable component of any advanced form of intelligence, biological or artificial?

40,"[P] Using GPT-3 to ""imagine"" novel physical artworks that are produced IRL",shoeblade,1601281946,"**Using GPT-3 text generation to create new artworks as a human-machine collaboration... more info and artworks** [**HERE**](https://areben.com/project/ai-am-i/)  **Forbes article** [**HERE**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2020/09/21/in-this-exhibition-an-ai-dreams-up-imaginary-artworks-that-artist-alexander-reben-then-creates-irl/)

“AI Am I? (The New Aesthetic)” is a series of artworks dreamed up by an AI and produced in real-life by the artist or others. A series of carefully curated “start texts” are fed into a text generation AI called GPT=3, which then outputs text that includes a description of an imaginary artwork, along with analysis of that artwork and other supporting text. Usually, a creative idea is conceived by a human and rendered with the help of technology. This series turns that notion on it’s head and represents a human-machine collaboration.

**Process of creation:**

* Description text, titles and quotes are generated using the GPT-3 AI using carefully created “start text”
* Output is curated and chosen by the artist (sometimes,from hundreds of outputs)
* When an output is generated that the artist likes, it is fed back into the system to generate more text, this machine-human loop is repeated until the final output is chosen
* Fake names are generated from a neural-network trained on names. 
* Birth location, birthdate and artwork year are made from a custom algorithm (unless GPT-3 included them in the description)
* Punctuation, spacing and other technical tweaks are made to the text (nothing that changes meaning)
* The artwork is produced in real life and/or displayed as a wall-tag

**Some examples of artworks along with GPT-3 generated text (more** [**HERE**](https://areben.com/project/ai-am-i)**):**

44,[D] Training an AI to play Among Us - the ultimate AI challenge?,Tullsokk,1601276571," I would just love to see something like GPT-3 beeing used in conjunction with an AlphaZero game AI to play a social deduction game such as Among Us. For those who don't know the game, you play with up to 10 other players, as a crew on a ship, where one player is a traitor who can kill other players. Kind of similar to the plot of The thing. Each time a body is discovered, the players debate which player is the traitor, cast a vote, and subsequently kills off the most suspected player.

Self play would obviously not work for establishing a convincing language model that would be able to shift the blame or suspicion to another player. But something like GPT-3 could be trained on text chat data, if that were available (which is suspect it isn't at this time). Doing voice to text would not be impossible, but would add a ton of complexity, and required a huge amount of stored audio. But a text based log could at least pick op on simple strategies, such as not talking too much, etc. In addition, the AI would need to be capable at solving the various minigames required to fix problems and sabotages on the ship, but it would have to avoid solving things in an inhumanly efficient way to avoid detection - which would also be interesting.

All in all, I could hardly imagine a more terrifying game for an AI to match human players in.  Nor a more entertaining an interesting one to play against a competent AI in.  

Do you think this would be a feasible challenge, given the existence of chat log data from the discussions before vote outs?

60,[D] Non-Commercial use of ML libraries,B-80,1601250959,"A lot of interesting models have a ""non-commercial use"" license, e.g. CC. Does this mean using a model licensed in this way to generate a youtube video would be prohibited?

For instance, let's say I use a model to add some effect to a video I post to youtube. Since youtube is making money (and perhaps I am making money as well if I have a big channel), does that make the use of the model illegal? What if I rewrote the entire code-base, but simply used the pretrained weights?

Does anyone have any insight into what's considered a commercial purpose, and whether some cases like this might fall under ""fair-use"".

78,[P] VkFFT update post - support of big FFTs (up to 2^24),xdtolm,1601232369,"Hello, this is an update post for VkFFT library (the last post: [VkFFT](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ia6gv1/p_new_vulkan_fft_library_vkfft_opensource/)). I have followed the feedback people provided me with and the main concern was the low dimension sizes support on VkFFT. So I spent some time and have implemented an algorithm that optimally splits FFT sequences in multiple uploads to the chip (known as Four Step FFT) and improved it that it groups nearby sequences to achieve non-strided memory accesses without any transpositions at all. So this update allows VkFFT to:

\-Do C2C FFTs of sizes up to - (2\^24, 2\^15, 2\^15), and C2R/R2C FFTs of sizes up to - (2\^14, 2\^15, 2\^15) . This is only limited by maxComputeWorkGroupCount parameter and I intend to increase the numbers by splitting submit calls. I will also reconfigure shaders to support double precision in one of the next updates, as twiddle factors are getting close to the levels of machine precision for single precision on these sizes.

\-Have no transposition steps at all. Grouping nearby FFTs provides better occupancy and achieves non-strided memory accesses far easier than doing sequence shuffles. However, this breaks locality for big FFTs, as Four Step FFT algorithm requires transposition after it to return data to the original order.  It can be done with position shuffle routine in all shaders and an in-place transposition shader launch, not yet fully implemented though. This doesn't matter for convolutions - they return to the input ordering automatically.

\-Big FFTs and convolutions were also tested on a real scientific Vulkan application [Vulkan Spirit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ilcw2f/p_vulkan_as_an_alternative_to_cuda_in_scientific/) for result correctness. The update to it will be uploaded to GitHub soon.

\-Big FFT sequences still retain 5-20% performance advantage over cuFFT. There are a lot of parameters that can be tweaked between different FFT sizes and GPUs to achieve even better results and this is something that can be done in the future - get specific launch configurations for different machines. Benchmark is added as a sample 4 in Vulkan\_FFT.cpp and benchmark\_cuFFT\_big\_FFTs.cu scripts, I will update comparison plots later.

\-A radix 3, 5 and other support can now be fairly easy implemented, due to the fact that VkFFT has no in-place transpositions anymore.

\-I have added shaders that overutilize register file instead of the shared memory for 8k and 16k x-sequences. This algorithm allows to improve performance on high-end cards and I will extend it to y and z sequences in the future.

Hope this makes VkFFT more useful to the community! GitHub link: [https://github.com/DTolm/VkFFT](https://github.com/DTolm/VkFFT)",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/j0wffm/p_vkfft_update_post_support_of_big_ffts_up_to_224/

#### [Controversial facial-recognition software used 30,000 times by LAPD in last decade, records show](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-21/lapd-controversial-facial-recognition-software)

It is now well-known that a number of police departments around  America have made use of facial recognition. But the Los Angeles Police  Department’s has been a particularly heavy user: the LAPD used facial  recognition software nearly 30,000 times since 2009. The figures reveal  the extensive use behind the vague and contradictory information the  LAPD provided about how and whether it uses the technology–the  department often denied using facial recognition at all. While the LAPD  does not have its own platform, it does have access to facial  recognition software through a regional database. The LAPD now claims it  was open about its use, but civil liberties advocates note the LAPD’s  recent denials which were only corrected after being questioned.

#### [Twitter and Zoom’s algorithmic bias issues](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/twitter-and-zoom-algorithmic-bias-issues/)

Social media platform Twitter has come under fire recently for an  image cropping algorithm that users noticed automatically focused on  white faces over black ones. While Twitter claims it tested the service  for bias before deploying it, the company accepts that it didn’t do  enough. Video conferencing service Zoom received criticism for similar  reasons after a PhD student tweeted about a Black faculty member’s  issues with the platform: when using a virtual background, Zoom would  remove his head. There has been debate about the causes of these  complications and whether Twitter’s cropping bias is real, but the fact  that it crops out Black people *at all* when it does not crop out white people renders its algorithm problematic.

A full response or pointers in the right direction would be appreciated. 

My problem isn't specifically related to multinomial LR, rather any problem in which I want to predict a vector Y from data X  where Y is of fixed length (say 4), all entries lie between 0 and 1, and sum to 1 (obviously this last condition can be relaxed by normalising the output).

Let's call the four elements of Y, A, B, C, and O (for other). In most of my training data, Y has this structure. Some of my data however has C and O combined (literally sum together their contributions to make a new O') so Y has three values (A, B, O' = O + C), and some has only A by itself (A, O' = O + B + C). I would like to use all data available without biasing or confusing my model. 

My final predictions will always be of the form A, B, C, and O.

93,[P] Editing Faces of Existing People with AI,Snoo_72253,1601216605,"# Face Editing with Latent Exploration &amp; Addition (StyleGAN2)

&amp;#x200B;

[This image of Obama is not real. It was generated with this method.](https://preview.redd.it/whhkxn0f9pp51.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97e97b3053adacb227d4cb53d4cf8ad33f497408)

With the help of StyleGAN2 &amp; some latent directions it is possible to edit faces of existing people to make them laugh / look serious, change their age, gender &amp; face position.

For that it is required to find the input latent that'll generate the face of your targeted person firstly.To do so, there's an algorithm that'll apply an optimizer to the values of the latent vector &amp; slowly, from coarse features to smaller details to make the generation closely fit to a given target image, which is simply an image of the person you'd like to find.The project\_images.py file from [this](https://github.com/justinpinkney/stylegan2) github will do just that for you.It outputs one .png showing the final result of the projection &amp; a .npy file which contains the latent that'll allow you to generate &amp; edit the image with StyleGAN2.

To change features (age, gender, etc...) you can add/subtract values to/from the different values of the latent vector. As one value isn't solely responsible for one feature guessing where &amp; how much you should add is likely not going to work out. Luckily, Robert Luxemburg shared latent directions for different facial features on Twitter. You can download them from [his twitter](https://twitter.com/robertluxemburg/status/1207087801344372736).

The .zip contains example images for each feature aswell as .npy files similar to the .npy files we generated in step 1. If you print the latent of these .npys out, you'll recognize that the different values of these latent vectors are generally very low. The next step now is to add &amp; subtract these values multiplied by different factors from your face latent &amp; see the effect.This way the face in the output is slowly altered &amp; will look older/younger or whatever feature you chose.

LMK what you think about this project in the comments please :-)

26,"[P] I created kMeans and kNN from scratch, you can too.",kidFNSS,1601176346,"Hi all!

I've created the unsupervised learning algorithm [kMeans clustering](https://github.com/nenyehub/kMeans) and the supervised learning algorithm [k-NearestNeighbors](https://github.com/nenyehub/kNN) from scratch in Jupyter notebooks. This is meant to help uncover the magic behind machine learning for those of us beginning in this complicated field.


These are two great algorithms for beginners just getting into Machine Learning - not only to use, but to really fundamentally **understand**. If you're using sklearn's built in ML models but are not sure how exactly they work, and machine learning still seems somewhat magical as mysterious to you as a whole - this will help you to realize that ML is about mathematics and a not-too-complex algorithms rather than some magical machine brain that gives answers. 


I researched these algorithms and then implemented them in Jupyter notebooks step-by-step with extensive documentation, explanation, and useful graphs so that my code is easy to follow along with. 


Both of these are using the Iris flower dataset for the purpose of example. You can download the notebooks and play with the code yourself, and even use them on different datasets to gain a better understanding of what exactly the algorithms do. 


I hope this helps you guys understand ML as much as it helped me. Please leave any thoughts, suggestions, or questions down below and if this proves useful to you leave a star on my repo. 


Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone is currently searching for GPUs to rent out, i probably found the cheapest Tesla GPUs available on the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

[Interruptible is even cheaper, starting from 0.7$\/hour](https://preview.redd.it/w8dnw0nfrip51.png?width=841&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b8c54efabe11af864465838aca57fb4e33f7344)

vast.ai lets you rent a server to train neural networks on. You're provided with a barebones version of Ubuntu with CUDA and Pytorch (or  Tensorflow if you want) and a Jupyter notebook. I chose it over services like AWS because the low price makes it suitable for beginners. However, any service that provides the above programs should work too.

I have a very basic understanding of Python and no history in machine learning though. I do however have about 2 months to work on this project and access to alot of ""premium"" learning tools through my education such as Pluralsight and others. 

The way I see it I have 2 options to attempt this, either I build it like marI/O and let it learn itself generation after generation or I go the mariFlow-way of things and let the AI learn from my/others gameplay.

Context:

I run a non-monetised, ad-free podcast a service to the community where I interview my ML Heroes.

I had the privilege to interview Andreas Mueller a few months ago:

We talked about how Andreas' overview of open source and machine learning and Scikit-Learn itself has evolved over the years how his approach and understanding to creating open source API's has evolved over the years that he's been active in the open source community.

13,[D] Recommendation Systems User Profile Streaming Data on GCP,m2rik,1601071926," 

I have a recommendation system that recommends articles to different users. I am planning to provide the recommendations in an off-line fashion. Where I already have a table in BigQuery which has the recommendations and an API call returns the recommendations for each page on the website.

Now I want to have another table called user\_profile  
 which stores the information about the user\_id|shown|clicked|  
 articles to the users. This should happen in real-time. I looked into [https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/streaming-data-into-bigquery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/streaming-data-into-bigquery) but it has limitations. I cannot write multiple rows into the table at once. Let's say I have 5000 unique users looking at an article once.

22,[P] BentoML 0.9.0 - the easiest way to create machine learning APIs,chaoyu,1601062822,"Hi everyone, want to share some exciting progress on our open source project BentoML, it is a framework for ML model serving and deployment. Here's what it does:

&amp;#x200B;

* Package models trained with *any ML framework* and reproduce them for model serving in production
* Package once and *deploy anywhere* for real-time API serving or offline batch serving
* High-Performance API model server with *adaptive micro-batching* support
* Central storage hub with Web UI and APIs for managing and accessing packaged models
* Modular and flexible design allowing advanced users to easily customize

&amp;#x200B;

**How it works:**

BentoML provides abstractions for creating a prediction service that's bundled with one or multiple trained models. Users can define inference APIs with serving logic with Python code and specify the expected input/output data format. Here's a simple example:

    import pandas as pd
    
    from bentoml import env, artifacts, api, BentoService
    from bentoml.adapters import DataframeInput
    from bentoml.frameworks.sklearn import SklearnModelArtifact
    
    from my_library import preprocess
    
    @env(infer_pip_packages=True)
    @artifacts([SklearnModelArtifact('my_model')])
    class MyPredictionService(BentoService):
        """"""
        A minimum prediction service exposing a Scikit-learn model
        """"""
    
        @api(input=DataframeInput(orient=""records""), batch=True)
        def predict(self, df: pd.DataFrame):
            """"""
            An inference API named `predict` with Dataframe input adapter, which codifies
            how HTTP requests or CSV files are converted to a pandas Dataframe object as the
            inference API function input
            """"""
            model_input = preprocess(df)
            return self.artifacts.my_model.predict(model_input)

At the end of your model training pipeline, import your BentoML prediction service class, pack it with your trained model, and persist the entire prediction service with save  
 call at the end:

    from my_prediction_service import MyPredictionService
    svc = MyPredictionService()
    svc.pack('my_model', my_sklearn_model)
    svc.save()  # default saves to ~/bentoml/repository/MyPredictionService/{version}/

This will save all the code, files, serialized models, and configs required for reproducing this prediction service for inference. BentoML automatically finds all the pip package dependencies and local python code dependencies and make sure all those are packaged and versioned with your code and model in one place.

With the saved prediction service, a user can easily start a local API server hosting it:

    bentoml serve MyPredictionService:latest
    
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

And create a docker container image for this API model server with just one command:

    bentoml containerize my_prediction_service MyPredictionService:latest -t my_prediction_service
    
    docker run -p 5000:5000 my_prediction_service

BentoML will make sure the container has all the required dependencies installed. In addition to the model inference API, this containerized BentoML model server also comes with instrumentations, metrics/health check endpoints, prediction logging, tracing and it is thus ready for your DevOps team to deploy in production.

If you are at a small team without DevOps support, BentoML also provides a [one-click deployment option](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML#deployment-options), which deploys the model server API to cloud platforms with minimum setup.

24,[R] Facebook AI Wav2Vec 2.0: Automatic Speech Recognition From 10 Minute Sample,Yuqing7,1601059149,"Current speech recognition systems require thousands of hours of transcribed speech to reach acceptable performance. However, a lack of transcribed audio data for the less widely spoken of the world’s 7,000 languages and dialects makes it difficult to train robust speech recognition systems in this area.

25,[P] SemTorch: A Semantic Segmentation library build above FastAI,WaterKnight98,1601056277,"Hi, guys:

I am happy to announce that I have released [SemTorch](https://github.com/WaterKnight1998/SemTorch).

This library allows you to train 5 different Sementation Models: UNet, DeepLabV3+, HRNet, Mask-RCNN and U²-Net in the same way.

For example:
```
# SemTorch
from semtorch import get_segmentation_learner

learn = get_segmentation_learner(dls=dls, number_classes=2, segmentation_type=""Semantic Segmentation"",
                                 architecture_name=""deeplabv3+"", backbone_name=""resnet50"", 
                                 metrics=[tumour, Dice(), JaccardCoeff()],wd=1e-2,
                                 splitter=segmentron_splitter).to_fp16()
```

This library was used in my other project: **[Deep-Tumour-Spheroid](https://github.com/WaterKnight1998/Deep-Tumour-Spheroid)**. In this project I trained segmentation models for segmenting brain tumours.
![image|689x489](upload://fPd0YmxxLzVM5blzzsb66o0D61E.jpeg) 

The notebooks can be found [here](https://github.com/WaterKnight1998/Deep-Tumour-Spheroid/tree/develop/notebooks). They are an example of how easily is to train a model with this library. You can use SemTorch with your own datasets!

In addition, if you want to know more about this project you can go to

**Deeper look in all the parameters of Semtorch**
All this library is focused in this function that will get new models and options over time.

```
def get_segmentation_learner(dls, number_classes, segmentation_type, architecture_name, backbone_name,

Tasks, stability, architecture, and compute: Training more effective learned optimizers, and using them to train themselves.

**Abstract:**

Much as replacing hand-designed features with learned functions has revolutionized how we solve perceptual tasks, we believe learned algorithms will transform how we train models. In this work we focus on general-purpose learned optimizers capable of training a wide variety of problems with no user-specified hyperparameters. *We introduce a new, neural network parameterized, hierarchical optimizer with access to additional features such as validation loss to enable automatic regularization.* Most learned optimizers have been trained on only a single task, or a small number of tasks. We train our optimizers on thousands of tasks, making use of orders of magnitude more compute, resulting in optimizers that generalize better to unseen tasks. The learned optimizers not only perform well, but learn behaviors that are distinct from existing first order optimizers. For instance, they generate update steps that have implicit regularization and adapt as the problem hyperparameters (e.g. batch size) or architecture (e.g. neural network width) change. Finally, these learned optimizers show evidence of being useful for out of distribution tasks such as training themselves from scratch.

**About the project:-**

PyGeneses is a PyTorch based Deep Reinforcement Learning framework that helps users to simulate artificial agents in bio-inspired environments. The framework provides in-built Deep RL algorithms and visualization of results from training in an interactive dashboard. The environments are a simplified abstraction of our real world, agents are put into this world and are allowed to interact with each other and the environment.

The power of PyGeneses is its clean and simple API which:

* Allows a user to run own simulation even if they have no knowledge about RL or DL.
* Allows a user with experience in Deep RL to tweak the model and parameters extensively.

What’s exciting about PyGeneses you ask, well, PyGeneses lets you create a working simulation by writing as little as 2 lines without any prerequisite knowledge whatsoever!! PyGeneses also provides tools that will help you visualize the results with minimal effort. So what are you waiting for, install PyGeneses today and become the god of your creation.

If you like the idea, do consider contributing to the project ([https://github.com/Project-DC/pygeneses](https://github.com/Project-DC/pygeneses)) this hacktoberfest. Thanks.

Here are some excerpts that I've found interesting.

* 'With a total of 68 SMs per GPU and a boost clock of 1710 MHz, the GeForce RTX 3080 GPU delivers 119 peak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS with FP16 accumulate, and with Sparsity enabled, 238 peak FP16 Tensor TFLOPS with FP16 accumulate. RTX 3080 delivers 238 peak INT8 Tensor TOPS and 476 peak INT4 Tensor TOPS, and double those rates with Sparsity enabled. ' (Page 22)

* 'Today, the default math for AI training is FP32, without Tensor Core acceleration. The NVIDIA Ampere architecture introduces new support for TF32, enabling AI training to use Tensor Cores by default with no effort on the user’s part. Non-tensor operations continue to use the FP32 datapath, while TF32 Tensor Cores read FP32 data and use the same range as FP32 with reduced internal precision, before producing a standard IEEE FP32 output. TF32 includes an 8- bit exponent (same as FP32), 10-bit mantissa (same precision as FP16) and 1 sign-bit. TF32 mode of an Ampere architecture GPU Tensor Core provides 2x more throughput than standard FP32.' (Page 23)

* 'NVIDIA has developed a simple and universal recipe for sparsifying deep neural networks for inference using a 2:4 structured sparsity pattern. The network is first trained using dense weights, then fine-grained structured pruning is applied, and finally the remaining non-zero weights are fine-tuned with additional training steps. This method results in virtually no loss in inferencing accuracy based on evaluation across dozens of networks spanning vision, object detection, segmentation, natural language modeling, and translation. ' (Page 24)

* 'By using PAM4 multilevel signaling techniques, GDDR6X transfers more data and at a much faster rate, moving two bits of information at a time, doubling the I/O data rate of the previous PAM2/NRZ signaling scheme. Data-hungry workloads, such as AI inference, game ray tracing, and 8K video rendering, can now be fed data at high rates, opening new opportunities for computing and new end-user experiences.' (Page 27)

* 'NVIDIA RTX IO is a suite of technologies that enable rapid GPU-based loading and decompression of game assets, accelerating I/O performance by up to 100x compared to hard drives and traditional storage APIs... NVIDIA RTX IO plugs into Microsoft’s upcoming DirectStorage API which is a next-generation
storage architecture designed specifically for state-of-the-art NVMe SSD-equipped gaming PCs.' (Page 30)

* Comparison between the RTX 2080, RTX 2080 Super, and RTX 3080 on pages 12 and 13. About a 30% uplift in non-sparse ML tasks, and a 170% uplift in sparse ML tasks.

* Comparison between the older Titan RTX and the new RTX 3090 on pages 38 and 39. Titan RTX actually wins in dense FP16 Tensor FLOPS with FP32 accumulate.

* Comparison of the RTX 2070 Super to the new RTX 3070 on pages 41 and 42. Looks to be about a 10% uplift in non-sparse ML tasks, and about a 120% uplift in sparse ML tasks.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/iz2kdw/d_some_notes_from_nvidias_whitepaper_for_the_rtx/

I would like ONNX because Unity's Barracuda ([https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.barracuda@1.0/manual/index.html](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.barracuda@1.0/manual/index.html)) seems to support the ONNX format, and I am trying to do some mobile device voice recognition within Unity.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like tf2onnx ([https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx)) does not work with the following model exported to .pb format ([https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r1/tutorials/sequences/audio\_recognition.md](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r1/tutorials/sequences/audio_recognition.md)).

&amp;#x200B;

Would I be best just using a different example/model and somehow saving that to ONNX in a more direct way? Does anyone have any good sources for training Voice Recognition models?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

2) Since my response variable is only for the machine and not the part is this data structure correct? The response is only unique to the machine serial number and not the part thus it is repeated many times. To me, this breaks the ""each row is one observation"" rule for a tidy dataset but I'm not sure how to structure it without one-hot-coding the part variable.

Figured it would make sense to do it well once and re-use it later, so we created an article about **top Kaggle tips&amp;tricks related to the binary classification** task.

We went through 10 Kaggle competitions and extracted some bits on a variety of topics:

* Modeling
* Dealing with imbalance problems
* Metrics
* Loss
* CV and evaluation strategies
   * My top pick is a comment on *adversarial validation* [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/discussion/111341).
* Post-processing
* Ensembling

Also we found **large (30+) collection of open source solutions** to competitions including winning ones, like to the [Humpback Whale Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification/discussion/82366).

There are many different channels for tech-related news. In our experience, these are often flooded with not-so-relevant posts which somehow fall under the ""tech"" umbrella. We've had a longstanding habit of sharing interesting ML-related articles and field-defining research with friends and peers, and know that we are by far not the only ones. That's why we decided to build a community dedicated to the field of ML. We hope that by narrowing the scope, we can build a space where ML people like ourselves can easily find interesting news, breakthroughs, and updates in the field, or essentially anything which could pique our interest.

**Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08378](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08378)

**Abstract**:

We derive the backpropagation algorithm for spiking neural networks composed of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons operating in continuous time. This algorithm, EventProp, computes the exact gradient of an arbitrary loss function of spike times and membrane potentials by backpropagating errors in time. For the first time, by leveraging methods from optimal control theory, we are able to backpropagate errors through spike discontinuities without approximations or smoothing operations. As errors are backpropagated in an event-based manner (at spike times), EventProp requires storing state variables only at these times, providing favorable memory requirements. EventProp can be applied to spiking networks with arbitrary connectivity, including recurrent, convolutional and deep feed-forward architectures. While we consider the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model in this work, our methodology to derive the gradient can be applied to other spiking neuron models. We demonstrate learning using gradients computed via EventProp in a deep spiking network using an event-based simulator and a non-linearly separable dataset encoded using spike time latencies. Our work supports the rigorous study of gradient-based methods to train spiking neural networks while providing insights toward the development of learning algorithms in neuromorphic hardware.

As soon as I saw how stable the generation of the filter was, I started experimenting with it and trying to figure out how they did it.

My current belief is as follows. They manually hooked up the features from their face detection/recognition algo into an anime face GAN.  So you can think of as those sliders that control age/hair colour/skin colour on the face generation website but hooked up to features from facial recognition.

SC definitely has singled out which algo features correspond to which facial features because they use hair colour/length in other filters.

This approach leads to the more generic anime faces seen in the filter, but is way more stable than something like https://selfie2anime.com/ that does image-to-image conversion.

Aside from that, the filter just does a simple posterisation and overlays the face in the right spot.

94,[R] Real World Games Look Like Spinning Tops,kk_ai,1600860560,"**Abstract:**

This paper investigates the geometrical properties of real world games (e.g. Tic-Tac-Toe, Go, StarCraft II). We hypothesise that their geometrical structure resemble a spinning top, with the upright axis representing transitive strength, and the radial axis, which corresponds to the number of cycles that exist at a particular transitive strength, representing the non-transitive dimension. We prove the existence of this geometry for a wide class of real world games, exposing their temporal nature. Additionally, we show that this unique structure also has consequences for learning - it clarifies why populations of strategies are necessary for training of agents, and how population size relates to the structure of the game. Finally, we empirically validate these claims by using a selection of nine real world two-player zero-sum symmetric games, showing 1) the spinning top structure is revealed and can be easily re-constructed by using a new method of Nash clustering to measure the interaction between transitive and cyclical strategy behaviour, and 2) the effect that population size has on the convergence in these games.

I am familiar with the basics of machine learning but I have always seen models work in an academic environment. I am interested in how ML is applied in real life and what it takes for a data science team to build, deploy and monitor a model with commercial applications.

I am trying to understand why it seems so hard to get models to production. Once you have a trained model and it's ready to go, what are the next steps that you usually follow in order to get it to production? 

`Deployment: In ML systems, deployment isn't as simple as deploying an offline-trained ML model as a prediction service. ML systems can require you to deploy a multi-step pipeline to automatically retrain and deploy model. This pipeline adds complexity and requires you to automate steps that are manually done before deployment by data scientists to train and validate new models`

I figured a naive way to do it is by reducing the num. of network parameters and why not replacing the 2D convolution with 2D depthwise convolution? Like what they did in MobileNet.

Tensorflow has the 2D depthwise conv. implemented, but they don’t have the transposed version of it. Thus, we can’t have a depthwise transposed convolutions on the Decoder network.

46,[R] Machine learning the thermodynamic arrow of time (Nature Physics),hardmaru,1600808518,"They show that machine learning methods can discover the thermodynamic arrow of time in the form of entropy production.

**Abstract**

The asymmetry in the flow of events that is expressed by the phrase ‘time’s arrow’ traces back to the second law of thermodynamics. In the microscopic regime, fluctuations prevent us from discerning the direction of time’s arrow with certainty. Here, we find that a machine learning algorithm that is trained to infer the direction of time’s arrow identifies entropy production as the relevant physical quantity in its decision-making process. Effectively, the algorithm rediscovers the fluctuation theorem as the underlying thermodynamic principle. Our results indicate that machine learning techniques can be used to study systems that are out of equilibrium, and ultimately to answer open questions and uncover physical principles in thermodynamics.

- build a prediction model in Python
- evaluate the model's performance
- provide insights into the data

Since I really liked the position I wanted to do a good job on it and spent quite a bit of time on the assessment. I also felt pretty good about my work.

61,[P] Domain Specific Hyperparameter Optimization for Logistic Regression,rnburn,1600796297,"With logistic regression it's possible to efficiently compute an approximation to the leave-one-out cross-validation. If *C* represents the hyperparameters, then this is an overview of how the approximation works:

1. Find the coefficients **b** that optimize the log-likelihood for the given *C.*
2. For each data index, *i*, compute the hessian **H***\_{-i}* and gradient **g***\_{-i}*  of the log-likelihood with the ith data entry removed.
3. Apply the [Matrix Inversion Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_matrix_identity) to efficiently compute the inverses **H***\_{-i} \^{-1}* .
4. Use **H***\_{-i} \^{-1}* and **g***\_{-i}* to take a single step of [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method_in_optimization) to estimate what the coefficients **b***\_{-i}* would be if the ith data entry was removed.
5. And finally, you can use the **b***\_{-i}*'s to make predictions for each *i* and derive an estimate of the LOOCV.

You can see the paper [A scalable estimate of the out-of-sample prediction error via approximate leave-one-out](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10243) by Kamiar Rad and Arian Maleki for more details.

Let *f(C)* denote the approximate LOOCV using log-likelihood as a function of *C.* Then not only can you compute the value of *f* efficiently, but you can also efficiently compute its gradient ∇*f* and hessian ∇∇*f.* With the gradient and hessian, it's possible to make hyperparameter optimization entirely internal to the fitting of logistic regression. There's no need to specify a search space or use Bayesian optimization -- you can optimize the approximate LOOCV objective directly.

I just made a release of a project [peak-engines](https://github.com/rnburn/peak-engines) (github) that provides this functionality. Here's how to use it:

Install the project. (Available from pypi).

    pip install peak-engines

Load an example dataset

    from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
    X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)

Find the *C* that optimizes the approximate LOOCV, *f.*

    import peak_engines
    model = peak_engines.LogisticRegressionModel()
    model.fit(X, y)
    print('C =', model.C_[0])

prints 

    C = 0.66474879

If we compute the LOOCV by brute force and plot, we can see that the approximation and its optimum very closely track the real LOOCV and optimum ([notebook](https://github.com/rnburn/peak-engines/blob/master/example/logistic_regression/aloocv_opt.ipynb)).

By turning hyperparameter optimization into a second order optimization problem, you can also easily handle penalty functions with multiple hyperparameters. For example, you can run

    model = peak_engines.LogisticRegressionModel(penalty='bridge')
    model.fit(X, y)
    print(model.hyperparameters_)

to fit hyperparameters for the [bridge penalty](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10618600.1998.10474784).

82,[D] I got the chance to interview an Applied Scientist at Amazon :),ibsurvivors,1600712647,"Hey all -

Had the chance to speak to an Applied Scientist at Amazon. Was super insightful, thought I'd post here.

\----

**Could you introduce yourself?**

Hi, I'm Eugene Yan. I work at the intersection of consumer data &amp; tech to build machine learning systems to help customers. I also write about how to be effective in data science, learning, and career.

Currently, I’m an Applied Scientist at Amazon helping users read more, and get more out of reading. We build book recommendation systems and contribute to efforts in discovery (e.g., search). Previously, I led the data science team at Lazada (acquired by Alibaba in 2016) and worked on e-commerce ML systems (e.g., ranking, automation, fraud detection).

**What does an average day look like?**

First, a disclaimer: Even for people with the *same* title (i.e., applied scientist), the average day will look different. It will also vary with the project’s lifecycle, such as research, prototyping, development, and maintenance. My role mostly involves prototyping and development.

My day usually has these buckets of activities:

* [**Stand-up**](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups): The team checks in on what’s being worked on, blocked, or needs help.
* **Data science/coding**: This includes (i) literature research, (ii) exploring and preparing data, (iii) running offline experiments, (iv) building prototypes (and giving demos), (v) writing and reviewing production code, and (vi) launching A/B tests.
* **Writing**: I write documents (e.g., one-pagers, design docs) to share ideas and get feedback. I also document my methodology, decisions, and experiment results for future reference. Writing my ideas and findings in documents makes them more scalable.
* **Reading**:[ Reading papers](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/why-read-papers/) helps me to be a more effective data scientist. Thus, I try to read at least an hour a day. The content includes internal/external articles and papers. (I have a bias towards papers on[ applied machine learning](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml).)
* **Meetings**: Not the most enjoyable activity for me. Nonetheless, meetings are essential for coordination and communication. A 30-min meeting beats days (or weeks) of email back and forth.

**What does a non-average day look like?**

I’m struggling with this question as most days don’t seem average. Nonetheless, here are some *exceptional* events that may come up:

* **High severity incidents**: This includes critical system failures, sometimes with customer-facing impact. Fortunately, this seldom happens for our team (i.e., less than a handful of times a year).
* **Migrating legacy systems**: All code eventually becomes legacy code. In a previous role, I was involved in a[ massive migration](https://eugeneyan.com/speaking/datacast-eugeneyan/#what-were-the-challenges-faced-during-the-alibaba-acquisition-of-lazada) (migrating cloud providers, data and machine learning systems) that required us to drop everything and solely focus on migration.
* **Attending conferences**: Many great conferences are online now which is great. Attending them requires having to balance between work and the conference.

**What’s your favourite part about the job?**

I *really* enjoy **working with data**. Through data (e.g., search logs, clickstreams, transactions), we understand our customers and how they interact with our platform and products. The data reveals interesting patterns in human behaviour. For example, consumption changes due to life-stages (e.g., becoming a parent) and socio-economic events (e.g., COVID-19, work from home). By understanding our customers better, we can serve them better.

I also enjoy **applying machine learning**. While data helps us understand customers, there’s far too much for a person (or even a large team) to process. Machine learning (algorithms) can help with this. For example, machine learning helps (i) automatically classify products and audit product reviews (ii) identify fraudulent sellers and products, (iii) recommend products to customers given their historical preferences, etc. Data and machine learning helps to write[ software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35).

Another aspect I enjoy is the amount of **leverage** working in a consumer tech company (e.g., Lazada, Amazon) provides. Our team can build and deploy machine learning systems to help customers around the world. It scales well too. Most of the system doesn’t need to change from country to country. Some necessary changes include using local data and adapting to local regulations (e.g., privacy). I get a huge kick from seeing customers benefit from our work (we see this through metrics and anecdotes).

**What’s your least favourite part about being an Applied Scientist?**

I’m still learning about how to manage this, but sometimes, I spend more time than I would like **writing documents and in meetings**. Nonetheless, it’s essential for socialising ideas and getting buy-in and feedback. I just wish I was more effective and faster at it.

Occasionally, stakeholders **suggest solutions that are far more complex** than it needs to be. I blame the overhyping of technology and machine learning in the media. When this happens, our team patiently tries to understand their perspective and educate them. Nonetheless, it takes considerable time and effort and distracts us from work that helps customers.

Lastly, because my work revolves around data, I’m also constrained by **access to high-quality data**. Delays happen now and then. Sometimes, it’s a minor lack of permissions which takes a few hours to a few days to resolve. Other times, we find that our system isn’t tracking a specific field and we need to update our trackers and wait a few months, or backfill the data.

**Do you think more people in tech would benefit from having a humanities background? You studied Psychology as an undergrad. What are some ways in which that has helped you in Data Science?**

Having a humanities background is associated with certain traits: Being more open-minded, critical thinking, better problem framing, research skills, and the ability to communicate with laymen. I think such traits would benefit everyone, not just tech folks. While a humanities degree helps with cultivating these traits, there are plenty of other ways—it can also come from having the opportunity to work on diverse, challenging problems, good role models, and work experience.

Other than the traits mentioned above, my Psychology degree taught me how to analyse qualitative and quantitative data. It also taught me about statistics (and how to be skeptical of it). In addition, I learned about how people perceive, think, and behave; this helps when I’m building customer-facing machine learning features.

**How is working at a big company like Amazon different to working at a startup like Lazada? Do you enjoy one more than the other?**

I’m still fairly new in Amazon. Nonetheless, I think Amazon’s more like a group of start-ups (rather than a big company). For example, each AWS service seems to operate like a start-up. In that sense, my experience so far has been similar to working in Lazada. We’re constantly experimenting, shipping, and getting feedback from customers. Nonetheless, being a global company, Amazon does provide slightly more leverage (see “What’s your favourite part about the job”).

I enjoy—and work best in—a role that’s between[ commando and soldier](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/commando-soldier-police-and-your-career/). Both my experience in Lazada and Amazon allow me to do this which plays to my strengths.

**Something I’ve noticed is that you’ve given a few talks and like to speak at meetups. How much do you think strong communication plays a role in being a successful data scientist? How can younger professionals cultivate that skill?**

Communication is one of the most important—if not *the* most important—skill for an effective data scientist. Initially, I didn’t think this way. But I reached out to several mentors asking what the most important skill for a data scientist was and guess what—it was communication. Thus, I focused on improving my communication and saw gains in my effectiveness within a year. (Ahmed wrote a great[ thread](https://twitter.com/AhmedTaiyeBnali/status/1302618264065908737) summarising my views.)

I think the best way to improve communication is through practice. At the start, it’s useful to read about the fundamentals of good writing and speaking —this arms us with knowledge from the experts. But to really get better, we need to practice.

How can we practice? Offer to write documents at work. This can be in the form of proposals, design documents, or internal newsletters. Or write about personal projects or what we learn on a blog. To practice speaking, offer to share at meet-ups or conferences about work-related or personal projects. With everything online now, it’s much easier.

Instead of going through the same horror of applying once again, I have decided to take up the masters degree program at Saarland University (Germany) in computer vision, the program is in part handled by the Max Planck Institute for Informatics and there are ample opportunities to work with researchers at MPI for both masters thesis and the occasional research assistant positions that opens up. Additionally, the research at MPI is a very strong fit for my area of interest which is an intersection of computer graphics and computer vision. My question is that if I were to apply to for PhD program in the United States later, would not doing my masters from the united states or north america (for which i'll have to break my bank) will be enough of a deterrent to essentially dampen my chances even if I manage to get in a paper or two at a top tier venue?

8,[D] Deconstructing the GPT-3 economy,bendee983,1600697531,"As we all know, OpenAI plans to commercialize GPT-3 come October. But will the massive language model actually become a profitable language model?

I had a deep dive into the costs of developing, running, and maintaining GPT-3. There's a lot we don't know about the process and the possible deals between OpenAI and Microsoft that might have cut down the costs. 

Here's my take, based on what we do know. I would be glad to have your opinion on it:

[https://bdtechtalks.com/2020/09/21/gpt-3-economy-business-model/](https://bdtechtalks.com/2020/09/21/gpt-3-economy-business-model/)

Key points:

* The costs of developing GPT-3 are in the eight-figures ($10M+)
* The costs of running GPT-3 are in the five-figures ($10K+/month)
* There are costs for staffing, support, legal, ethics, privacy, security, etc

For  my research work we are to classify news telecasts (bbc) into 21  political topics. We have the transcripts for these telecasts and we  want to separate them into partition of texts that talk about same  (roughly) topic.

The current  approach that I am following is to check sentence by sentence and if the  current sentence has a similarity beyond a threshold with the previous  sentence, then we put them in same partition. While this approach works,  we want to improve the quality of partitions.

How  do I go about this? Is there a better algorithm to do so? More so  something that works for news telecasts transcripts where topics can  frequently change.

Recently I wanted to look at some programming languages aside from Python to do deep learning with. Heresy, I know. I came along Kotlin and checked out DL4J as a deep learning framework.

The problem DL4J is that it is a Java library and Java code has not gotten much prettier since the last time I had to write it in my first semester at university. Declaring a network architecture in DL4J, in my opinion, lacked the flexibility and cleanliness of doing it in Python. Fortunately, Kotlin makes your life much easier when working in the Java ecosystem. I wrote an embarrassingly small library of functions that wrap DL4J and let you define networks in a semi-declarative way that I find very readable.

33,[R] Dimension-Adaptive Neural Architecture for Multivariate Temporal Data,malekzadeh,1600676496,"It's challenging to use deep neural nets where the dimensions of data can accidentally or deliberately change at the test time. For example in processing sensor data being adaptive to the sampling rate or the number of available or selected sensors is very important. To address this problem, we built a dimension-adaptive pooling (DAP) layer that makes neural nets robust to temporal changes in sampling rate and in sensor availability. DAP operates on convolutional filter maps of variable dimensions and produces an input of fixed dimensions suitable for feedforward and recurrent layers. It is built upon the idea of Global Max Pooling and Spatial Pyramid Pooling, but more flexible and accurate than them.

We propose a dimension-adaptive training (DAT) procedure to generalize over the entire space of feasible data dimensions at the inference time. DAT comprises the random selection of dimensions during the forward passes and optimization with accumulated gradients of several backward passes. We then combine DAP and DAT to transform existing non-adaptive deep architectures into a Dimension-Adaptive Neural Architecture (DANA) without altering other architectural aspects. DANA does not need up-sampling or imputation, thus reduces unnecessary computations at inference time. Experimental results on public datasets show that DANA prevents losses in classification accuracy of the state-of-the-art deep architectures, under dynamic sensor availability and varying sampling rates.

We focus on mobile and wearable sensor data, but DANA can also easily be used for other data types, e.g. images of different resolutions or audio of variable frequencies or lengths.

I'd like to know more/read more about ML techniques that deal with time series data other than RNN(and variations)/CNN.

1/ I only have 400 data points 
2/ Would like to start simple

Transforming the problem to a tabular supervised problem is one way to go but with a lookback of 15 timesteps for 30 features, that would basically mean 450 columns for 400 rows, not ideal. 
I read about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_autoregression but it seems more appropriate when each variable can be expressed with the lagged features of itself + other variables. I don't have that type of causality in my situation where only one variable could be expressed this way.

37,[D] Suggestions for Machine Learning Development Laptop,PiranhaSyx,1600675413,"So hello everyone,

I am a PhD Student, doing machine learning research and I am in the market for a new laptop. I currently have a early 2015 Macbook Pro 13"", which is, well, aged enough to make me consider an upgrade. So I would like your help and suggestions to make a choice. I would say that I have a budget of around 3000 Euros and that I am based in EU.

Effectively what I am looking for is laptop that's gonna last me for quite some time, is going to be reliable and have a lot of battery life (under normal work loads and not neural network training obviously). I mention training neural networks, which should hardly be the case in most cases as it is unreasonable to train complete models on a laptop. My most demanding workload will be consisted of development/coding and testing (training) smaller iterations of my models before I deploy them on a GPU server that is gonna handle the days/weeks of training required.

To that end, I have concluded that my 13"" screen is too small to spend so much time on it and I am aiming for something like a 15""-16"" laptop. I have narrowed it down to 3 choices that I would like to list in a ""best first"" manner:

1. Macbook Pro 16"" - Late 2019 - with a dedicated GPU in the form of 5600M (8GB) and 32GB or ram.
2. LambdaLabs Tensorbook (details here: [https://lambdalabs.com/deep-learning/laptops/tensorbook](https://lambdalabs.com/deep-learning/laptops/tensorbook) )
3. Razer Blade 15 Advanced Edition with RTX 2080

However, I am facing a lot of tough choices here.

While I would prefer the Macbook, Apple doesn't seem to play well with Nvidia which I would require for running experiments (even small ones) locally on GPU. There is an alternative to using, let's say tensorflow, with an AMD card with ROCm but I would have to boot Ubuntu - which pretty much negates the point of buying a mbpro.  I could buy a nvidia eGPU but there's no guarantee it's going to work in the long term and every MacOS update could potentially brake the compatibility. And last and worst I could use Keras with PaidML but for anyone doing active research would know that Keras is not the way to go if you want to do innovative research and publish your work (so that's off the table).

As my ""best option"" for the mbpro is to book on Ubuntu, why pay the premium of apple and not just go for the LambdaLabs Tensorbook which seems to be tailored to my needs (per say). The only reason I'm sceptical about LambdaLabs is because a) I have never heard of them before today and b) what's going to happen if I have a service issue given that I'm based in EU and the company is based in the US. I can't go without a laptop for a long period of time...

Razer Blade comes third only because I feel like I'm paying extra for literally features (like a high refresh rate monitor) that I don't need. Otherwise I feel like it has a good enough build quality and overall specs to do what the Tensorbook would do for me (given that it's going to run Ubuntu anyway).

Some quick quirks of mine:

\- I hate working on windows and I refuse to do so. For anything but work, Windows is OK, I just can't stand working on windows.

\- I understand that if you read this far you might be confused as to why I need a GPU at all if I am going to run the majority of my workload to remote servers, but I would like to afford the luxury of running small experiments in my laptop before I just go off and wait 72hours for results. I could technically do it in CPU (which all 3 could cover as they are Intel based), but time is money and money is what I need (being a student and all), so I'm looking for more effective options so to speak.

Also, should I wait for the next generation of macbook pro's coming out in a short while? I am clearly not thinking about Apple Silicon systems which will most likely not be compatible with my needs, but for the new Intel processors. Is it worth the wait, performance wise, if I end up using CPU for the experiments that is.

#### [Why kids need special protection from AI’s influence](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/17/1008549/kids-need-protection-from-ai/)

Child are “often at the forefront when it comes to using and being  used by AI.” For example, voice assistants are recording their voices, and  recommender systems are influencing their worldviews. While these effects are also apparent for adults, children are  especially at risk because they are still “developing intellectually and  emotionally and physically,” which makes them very “shapeable” and  vulnerable. To address this, UNICEF and the Beijing Academy of Artificial  Intelligence separately published new AI ethics guidelines specifically  tailored toward protecting the interests and well-being of children. This is a step in the right direction, and both organizations are  launching pilot programs to study the effectiveness of their guidelines  in practice.

#### [Face-mask recognition has arrived - for better or worse](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/09/face-mask-recognition-has-arrived-for-coronavirus-better-or-worse-cvd/)

To help governments and health authorities track and improve  face-mask usage, many companies have now developed face-mask recognition  software that can identify whether or not someone is wearing a mask  from live surveillance footage. In theory, this incurs less privacy intrusions than face-recognition,  because it is not able to identify who a person is, just whether or not  they’re wearing a mask.

While proponents argue that widespread deployment of this technology  would enable more effective health awareness campaigns, critics are  concerned about the slippery slope it might bring. Using face-mask recognition on live CCTV sets “a dangerous precedent for  what happens when the pandemic is over.” Experts also believe that “getting people to wear masks might not  require a technological fix in the first place,” and it is essentially  “introducing software—and igniting privacy debates—to address a problem  while completely side-stepping the underlying issue.”

74,[D] My Novel-Ish Approach To Person Re-Identification... Pick apart my approach please,eng_steve,1600625363,"Alright, so for work I've been tasked with prototyping a person re-identification (PRI) solution (key-word here is prototyping, this is just one of many approaches I plan to explore and am certainly open to suggestions). First I'll frame the problem: I've done a cursory survey of the state-of-the-art in PRI and it seems that most approaches involve some deep neural network to not only extract bounding boxes containing a person but also to extract the features belonging to that person. This requires training and custom architectures. This isn't practical in the real world - say an individual walks into a store, you likely won't have an abundance of information on that person in their same outfit, etc, to train a model. Moreover by the time you train a model that person might be out of the store. Finally, people want re-identification to seamlessly integrate with their existing hardware more or less which certainly do not have the compute power required to facilitate a DNN.

I've been focused exclusively on the person re-identification step right now rather than the generic person detection/tracking since that's the easy part. I've been using this dataset: [https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-bischof/lrs/downloads/prid11/](https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-bischof/lrs/downloads/prid11/) to test my PoC. With that all out of the way lets' talk about the approach, it's as follows:

1. Gather 20-30 detection boxes for each individual person (this can be performed by initializing a Kalman Filter on each discrete detection box and saving the pixels contained within each box while tracking. For a single video feed this is all that's needed to differentiate between individual people). Using an architecture like Mobilenet optimized for edge devices this means only about 1-2 seconds of information is needed on an individual. The resultant 20-30 detection boxes for each individual are saved. We'll call this their ""profile""
2. Next, we slice each ""profile"" into thirds or quarters (chunks). This is a loose assumption, but we can assume for example that the top third will contain the person's head, with the bottom two thirds containing some information about the individual's clothing. (This can be made more robust by sampling pixels in the neighborhood of each key point detected by pose estimation, but again... this is a prototype).
3. We parse the RGB channels. This is where things get a bit weird. I'm treating each R, G, and B layer of each ""chunk"" as its own set of features. Next, I'm applying PCA to each chunk, reducing the dimensionality by n-components, with n=3 for now (normally, PCA would be applied to a set of images rather than a single image in order to reduce the dimensionality of each image in the context of the whole dataset). Then, I'm actually completely discarding the resultant reduced ""feature set"" and instead grabbing the principal components. The idea here is that each PC can be thought of as a measure of the intensity of the variance (kind of, I know it's more accurately a representation of covariance) in each channel in each chunk that is a bit more descriptive than just raw variance since it can be expanded into n-components and tuned in that manner.

To recap, at this point we have a ""profile"" of each person. For one person this is a tensor of 30x3x3x3 - 30 bounding boxes per person, 3 chunks per bounding box, 3 channels per chunk, and 3 principal components per channel. This is a super compact representation of each individual person. To compute the person's ""profile"" takes about 20 milliseconds, so it won't add much overhead on top of the detection.

To test the efficacy of this approach I went ahead and set up a simulation. I have a test bank of like 200 people if I remember correctly. I select one person at random and take 30 random samples from that person to obtain their profile. I then, for 100 simulations, take one random image of this individual (an image not in the profile of course) and drop it into a pool containing images from 4 other individuals. For each individual, the average euclidean distance is taken between the 1x3x3x3 profile of that individual and 30x3x3x3 ""profile"" points of the target individual. The person with the smallest average distance is taken as the re-identified person. I sum the number of times that the correct person is chosen and take that as the accuracy of the algorithm. In order to get the average accuracy, I ran this whole simulation 500 time. 

The result was pretty decent - 85% accuracy on average. This couples with the extremely fast computation time, low compute power requirements, and the need for only seconds of data per person in order to obtain results makes some variation of this approach well suited for a real-world application. Of course though, it can always be improved upon, which is why I'm here. I'm also looking for some experts on PCA as I am not one - I have had trouble finding applications of applying PCA to a single image and am a bit concerned that my approach, while apparently working, is just a fluke of some sort.

77,[P] Interpolating between existing human faces (all US Presidents),N2AI,1600624135,"This project I've completed uses StyleGAN2 &amp; face aligner.  
StyleGAN2 will produce a detailed, realistic looking square image of the trained type given any random input latent. Using an optimization algorithm, you can explore the latent space in order to find an accurate representation of a real life example of the given type. The results of this are very crappy, unless you align the target image beforehand to fit the outputs.

&amp;#x200B;

In my project, this involved using a face aligner python script that would 1) recognize the face in the image 2) cut it out and center it 3) make sure key features like eyes are on the right x &amp; y values to best resemble a normal StyleGAN2 output.  
I've gone through that process for every American president from Washington -&gt; Trump &amp; saved the input latent, that would create a (semi) accurate double of them.   
On request I can share the folder of all latents with you.

After that I've linearly interpolated 100 times between each different presidential latents and compiled the result in an animation.

20,Classification Using LSTM vs. Classification using K-Means on sentence encodings [Discussion],cvantass,1600543738,"In NLP, what exactly is the difference between using an LSTM for sentence classification and using a simple K-Means algorithm once you already have sentence encodings?

Tell me if I’m understanding this correctly:

Both require the input to be encoded into a fixed length vector from which decisions about category are made. In an LSTM, this vector would be the final hidden layer, and for K-Means, it would just be the encoded sentence vector. It almost seems more useful to go the K-Means route because it is then easier to measure similarity between sentences if you wanted to, or do all kinds of clustering visualizations and manipulations/calculations as opposed to just receiving the final predicted category with no extra context, which is what you would get as output from your typical LSTM.

So, my questions are as follows: Is one of those approaches better than the other, and why? Is it more accurate, more efficient, etc.? Am I even understanding this correctly?

I’ve used LSTM’s for NLP many a time but have never actually tried the K-Means approach though I’m contemplating giving it a go this time around.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/ivz3h6/classification_using_lstm_vs_classification_using/

Hello,

I am trying to do a machine learning task and in my current dataset I have featurized protein sequences, so for every protein I have 27 features which are float arrays of different length. So, I have a numpy array of shape (556,1) and for every sample it have 27 features so (27,1) and each feature has variable length and the same feature might have a different shape for different samples. Trying to use this data with sklearn gives the following error ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence  
and using it with keras gives the following error ValueError: Failed to convert a NumPy array to a Tensor (Unsupported object type numpy.ndarray)  
. If i try to convert it with input = input.astype(np.float32),  
 i get the same error ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.

Any idea how to fix this or how to I get this data working? I thought about padding each feature to equal length but some features are too big about 10k length so Im skeptical about doing that.

39,[D] Car game for Reinforcement Learning (CaRL),mad_ger,1600530012,"Hi, 

Over the past couple months (actually year), I was working on a car game for reinforcement learning, called CaRL. Since this project is in a very early release stage, I would be thankful for stars on my GitHub page: 

https://github.com/MatthiasSchinzel/CaRL 

 

With this game I want to bring reinforcement learning algorithms closer to real applications - making it easier to train your RL algorithm for a self-driving car, be it an RC car following a road or maybe one day a real car.  

 

So, if you check out the GitHub, you will see it is actually just a black and white road. The reason for the high abstraction level is, to make it kind of “domain agnostic”. It is of course not really domain agnostic, but all you need is something to extract the ego road lane.  This can be done with for example a UNET of you can find the lane markings on the left and right and construct the ego lane from that. I even made a proof of concept of the above Idea: I let my trained SAC steer a car in GTA 5: https://github.com/MatthiasSchinzel/Soft-Actor-Critic-Playing-GTA 

Another reason for this high abstraction level: it makes it really easy to make your own tracks. Use paint, download real roads from google maps, you name it! And as we all know: the more data the better. 

 

One last thing about the abstraction: In my opinion, creating a 3D game, which is looking as realistic as possible is far more difficult, than annotating roads from images and train a segmentation algorithm on it.  

 

Since RL is so far mostly a R&amp;D topic, I would be happy if researches would use this! If you are a student or someone working on RL, please also give me feedback!

[Mode collapse approaches, data augmentation for GANs, and StyleGAN vs BigGAN](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hwf093/d_what_are_the_recent_papers_that_address_the/fyzionh/) by u/gwern

&gt;  Data augmentation historically just screws up GANs, causing G to emit artifacts, but apparently all you have to do, turns out, is always apply data augmentation to all images before training or scoring (rather than the usual approach of augmenting just reals), and then it Just Works. So you can get surprisingly good results out of StyleGAN training from scratch on just thousands of images, even.

[Breaking the Quadratic Attention Bottleneck In Transformers](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hxvts0/d_breaking_the_quadratic_attention_bottleneck_in/), ft. u/gwern and u/Aran_Komatsuzaki

&gt; One of the most frustrating limitations of GPT-3 is the context window: 2048 BPEs runs out fast when you start prompt programming something hard, and hacks like BPEs have nasty &amp; subtle side-effects (eg no puns or rhyming ;_;). How do we get future Transformers with reasonable context windows and/or memory?

[Best GAN tricks](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/i085a8/d_best_gan_tricks/), ft. u/felixludos and u/ihaveunitdeterminant

&gt; Like most AI accelerators that aren't just dumb systolic arrays (*cough* TPU *cough*), Graphcore's chips are intrinsically model parallel. This means they can run at very low batch sizes, saving memory, increasing responsiveness and adding more flexibility in what sort of training algorithms you can run. They also support sparsity very well.

&gt; But most interesting works are either raw-only (WaveNet, Jukebox), or compare raw audio with spectrograms, because it's not obvious when one approach is better or not. Raw audio is more end-to-endy but spectrograms are more bio, human ear ignores phase information. So in case of raw audio you can spend more resources on processing phase you won't hear, in case of spectrum you can get weird artifacts a-la lossy audio.

[A brief summary of the reinforcement learning landscape](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ihwkii/r_understanding_the_reinforcement_learning/g33cs61/), by u/mind_juice

&gt; Though the community continues to develop new algorithms, state-of-the-art results have stopped improving in the last couple of years. Since RL algorithms that use a tremendous amount of online data to learn from scratch are infeasible to apply in the real-world, much research has moved to fields such as Meta-RL, offline RL, and integrating RL with domain-knowledge, integrating RL and planning, etc.

[How do you unit test end-to-end ML pipelines?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/iipymn/d_how_do_you_unit_test_endtoend_ml_pipelines/g39ujp6/), by u/farmingvillein

&gt; As perhaps a bit of tldr: once you've got the bare minimum data-replay testing in place (""yeah, it is probably working, because the results are pretty close to what they were before""), I'd encourage you to consider focusing your energy toward thinking of testing as outlier detection. Outliers, in real-world ML systems, tend to be harbingers of things that are wrong systematically, upstream data problems, and logic (pre-/post-processing) problems.

&gt; Coming from a no-name Indian engineering college with meh grades, you do have to get a bit creative, very persistent and build credibility for yourself. The examples above are one way to do so, but you can also maybe articulate your thoughts as really good blog posts and arxiv papers, or show great software engineering skills in open-source (i.e. without having to land a stint at a big research lab first).

&gt; So, a theoretical way to overcome this problem is to increase model's capacity (including training it longer). This is the reason the likelihood-based models that produce decent samples (Glow and NVAE) are so huge, in my opinion. One might say: fine, let's instead optimise KL(pmodel(x)||pdata(x)) and benefit from its mode-seeking behaviour. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to actually do this with only samples from pdata(x).

&gt; Unfortunately, over the last few years, there has been a lot of confusion around the definition and properties of optimal transport (OT) in the ML literature. Many authors define loss functions that are inspired by the Wasserstein distance but do not really fit into the scope of OT theory: crucial distinctions are often lost in translation between geometry, stats and ML papers.

Abstract:

&gt;Class-conditional language models (CC-LMs) can be used to generate natural language with specific attributes, such as style or sentiment, by conditioning on an attribute label, or control code. However, we find that these models struggle to control generation when applied to out-of-domain prompts or unseen control codes. To overcome these limitations, we propose generative discriminator (GeDi) guided contrastive generation, which uses CC-LMs as generative discriminators (GeDis) to efficiently guide generation from a (potentially much larger) LM towards a desired attribute. In our human evaluation experiments, we show that GeDis trained for sentiment control on movie reviews are able to control the tone of book text. We also demonstrate that GeDis are able to detoxify generation and control topic while maintaining the same level of linguistic acceptability as direct generation from GPT-2 (1.5B parameters). Lastly, we show that a GeDi trained on only 4 topics can generalize to new control codes from word embeddings, allowing it to guide generation towards wide array of topics.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/ivhnyd/r_gedi_generative_discriminator_guided_sequence/

Let's say you're walking around and when you press the interact button near a person, instead of just the typical ""hey"" voiceline repeated every time you press interact, instead an AI could give off realistic dialogue on the fly and simulate realistic human speech.

So, I guess almost everyone's going with IL. Does Reinforcement Learning come into the picture somewhere? Offline RL? Does Control Theory have a role to play?

**Learning Theory research:**

My first major was physics and I like how rigorous we are about research and understanding why things work. For example, deep learning and GANs are great, but do we know why these things actually work? I am interested in this kind of research, but I feel like most of the ML world is focused on getting papers out, not so much proving theory. I feel like we won't really get anywhere unless we focus on learning theory.

If I am interested in this type of research, what papers / leaders in the field should I look at? What type of research at my university should I look for / how can I express this interest to my adviser?

I am questioning if because of my reasoning above, I would like more **math based research**.

This is not double blind at all! This is troubling and is probably a factor in the merit issues with publications nowadays.

It would be great if arxiv could have a prepublication option that can hide your names and institution until publication. You could turn this feature off if you decide not to publish anywhere else.

Remo is a web-based application to organize, annotate and visualize Computer Vision datasets. The idea is to provide a private platform to manage images, before and after training models.

It is distributed via `pip` and can be used locally, served on a server to collaborate or also used entirely off Colab Notebooks.

It also comes with a Python library, to help the modelling: [https://github.com/rediscovery-io/remo-python](https://github.com/rediscovery-io/remo-python)

 This is still work in progress, but it already has some nice functionalities.  Goals of the python library are to help:

* **easily visualize and browse** images, predictions and annotations
* **quickly check statistics** on datasets
* **offer** **flexibility in slicing data, without moving it around**: you can create virtual train/test/splits or have data in different folders or even select specific images using tags
* **with a more standardized interface** across different tasks (e.g. PyTorch's ImageFolder requires a very specific folder structure)

[GitHub](https://github.com/jambo6/neuralCDEs-via-logODEs). 

Here, we show how to use a particular numerical solver from stochastic analysis, *which takes steps over multiple data points at once*. In machine learning terms we then reinterpret this quite straightforwardly: it's a very particular choice of binning strategy. We then show that you can use it to process time series of length up to 17k. We've also got an implementation over in [torchcde](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/torchcde) that allows you to use it easily.

61,[D] Cross validation vs Kaggle Score,ez613,1600380950,"I've allready see this question, but didn't see anything that convince me.

I'm working on the Titanic prediction, and make a model. I tested it on my test set (0.3 of data), and had a pretty good score : 0.82. So I submited, but it got just 0.76. So I thought that it was just ""luck"" on my test set, so I thinked to use k-fold to have a better idea of the ""real"" score. But, regardless of the k-s I've test (3,5,7...), the big majority was better than 0.76, and often over 0.81. 

I've seen a answer to this question, that say that when some use cross-validation for model selection and/or hyperparameters tuning, we are overfitting and those results are not representatives. This is logic; however my model was a simple LogisticRegression without hyperparmeters, and there was just a single model.

My second thought was that maybe it was some ""lack of luck"" between the model and the datas, so I tested with another model (simplest SVM without hyperparmeters), and I got the same problem.

78,[D] Analysis of Tesla A100 vs RTX 3080 for DNN training,one_lunch_pan,1600366918,"Hello everyone!  


The RTX3080 [whitepaper](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/geforce/ampere/pdf/NVIDIA-ampere-GA102-GPU-Architecture-Whitepaper-V1.pdf) was finally released by NVIDIA yesterday. There are three very important details that not many people have talked about. Note that here I'm just talking about training, and none of what I'm going to say applies to inference settings.  
\- Tensor core performance will be poor -- about 59.5 TFLOPS for dense mixed-precision training. For comparison, an RTX2080Ti has 56.4 TFLOPS ( [source](https://www.industry-era.com/images/pdf/NVIDIA-Turing-Architecture-Whitepaper.pdf) ), a V100 has 125TFLOPS ([source](https://images.nvidia.com/content/volta-architecture/pdf/volta-architecture-whitepaper.pdf)), and an A100 has 312TFLOPS ([source](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/Data-Center/nvidia-ampere-architecture-whitepaper.pdf)). Keep in mind that while these numbers are theoretical, large enough networks are likely to saturate the device anyway; I have seen A100 achieving &gt;250TFLOPS on 4k x 4k matrix multiplication. 

\- Memory bandwidth is 760GB/s. This is low, compared to 900GB/s on the V100 and 1500GB/s on the A100.

\- I don't see any mention of L2 cache residency control in the RTX3080 whitepaper. This feature was introduced in the A100 and allows CUDA programmers to prevent some part of the L2 cache from being automatically evicted. This has not yet been leveraged by frameworks, but this could (perhaps) be a big deal that allows things like doing batchnorm ""for free"" after a convolution, or doing softmax ""for free"" after a matrix multiplication.  


All in all, I would expect the RTX3080 to be between 2x and 5x slower than an A100 for large training tasks that are not bound by disk i/o. Additionally, given how power hungry (325-350W) the RTX3080  is, it will be difficult to power and cool 4 of them in a single machine without throttling. What I'm getting at is that, for some kind of tasks and some kind of people, renting an A100 on the cloud could be more cost-effective than an RTX3080. For example, $1000 could get you about 500 GPU-Hours on the A100, or 150 PFLOPS-hours in a heavily compute-bound regime (e.g., transformer). This is equivalent to running an RTX3080 for 2500 hours, which would cost $750 + $130 of electricity (assuming $0.15/kwH). By the way, just to put things in perspective, 150PFLOPS-hours also corresponds to 6 PFLOPS-days, which is almost enough GPU power to train OpenAI's 1v1 bot (less than 10 PFLOPS-days according to [https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/](https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/))   


Of course, this is all speculative and simplified. We'll know more when both architectures are formally benchmarked. My point is that researchers and labs should think twice before rushing to build an RTX3080 rig -- though it could still be worth it.

89,[R] A Systematic Characterization of Sampling Algorithms for Open-ended Language Generation,moinnadeem,1600358998,"Hey everyone!

Excited to announce ""A Systematic Characterization of Sampling Algorithms for Open-ended Language Generation"", published at AACL 2020.

Sampling from a language model is a crucial task, but little work has been done to define the desirable properties of a sampling algorithm. We tease apart some common properties of sampling algorithms and develop novel algorithms to test whether these properties are important or not.

Abstract:

&gt;This work studies the widely adopted ancestral sampling algorithms for auto-regressive language models, which is not widely studied in the literature. We use the quality-diversity (QD) trade-off to investigate three popular sampling algorithms (top-k, nucleus and tempered sampling). We focus on the task of open-ended language generation. We first show that the existing sampling algorithms have similar performance. After carefully inspecting the transformations defined by different sampling algorithms, we identify three key properties that are shared among them: entropy reduction, order preservation, and slope preservation. To validate the importance of the identified properties, we design two sets of new sampling algorithms: one set in which each algorithm satisfies all three properties, and one set in which each algorithm violates at least one of the properties. We compare their performance with existing sampling algorithms, and find that violating the identified properties could lead to drastic performance degradation, as measured by the Q-D trade-off. On the other hand, we find that the set of sampling algorithms that satisfies these properties performs on par with the existing sampling algorithms.

I tried to train it for about 3 days on my own GPU which is GTX 970. The problem is I can't use bigger batch size than 8 because pytorch says memory runs out and the creator of the implementation says that lower values than 32 can cause it hard to learn the attention. Still, after the 3 hours of training I can recognize Trump's voice mumbling some nonsense with a strong high pitch background noise. But when I listened to the test audio samples from across the training, it didn't sound like it had improved much for the last 1.5 days of training or something.

Should I still just try to continue training it even though it seemed to not make visible progression? Or could the problem be in the training data?

So I tough what if Artificial Neural Networks are not enough and we need another construct like Artificial Genome (for example: a sort of mechanism in the form of some meta data or hyper parameters from previous models and weights on them to simulate the selection of beneficial 'genes'). I know evolutionary computing/ genetic algorithms try to simulate the 'process' of evolution, but it's not really the same. What I mean is creating models of Artificial Genomes to complement ANN's to make a new architecture. So the ANN model architecture and the training process will be automatically created by the definitions in the Artificial Genome.

23,[D] Content-Based Image Retrieval - guideline + PyTorch implementation by CV researcher,kk_ai,1600336908,"Content-based image retrieval is an important task in CV, as it allows you to find images containing some attributes which are not in the image metadata.

To that end, we compiled guideline on how to build such system together with underlying concepts' explanations.

We cooked example task: *find face images with certain attributes* (we use CelebA dataset), that we approach by using **Siamese Networks / Triplet Loss**.

&amp;#x200B;

Here, are the main points:

**Prepare balanced training triplets.**

They should consist of three elements

1. An image (which is the anchor), 
2. Its attributes vector (which is positive), 
3. And a negative attributes vector (the negative).

As for creating *negative attributes*, common strategy, is to do the following:

* Sample a random attributes vector from the training data,
* Check that is different than our positive vector,
* Use it as negative.

**note:**  
It's just one example/typical strategy. I would love to hear what you do to create negative attributes. Do you know some tricks of the trade that you can share?

**How to design the model and train it?**

In principle, you need a neural network architecture that learns image and attribute vector embeddings in the same embedding space.

* To learn the image embeddings, we use a CNN (i.e. ResNet-50) that outputs an N-D vector. ""N"" is embedding space dimensionality.
* To learn the attributes vector embeddings use - for example - MLP.

With those at hand we can try to sketch training loop:

    anchor = self.CNN(img_anchor)
    positive = self.MLP(att_positive)
    negative = self.MLP(att_negative)
    loss = criterion(anchor, anchor, negative)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step() 

**Evaluation of the trained model.**

Usually go with either:

* *Precision@K (P@K)* \-&gt; used when you are only interested in retrieving correctly a limited number of images, like in the recommendation systems,
* *Mean Average Precision (mAP)* \-&gt; more expensive to compute and less intuitive, but it evaluates a retrieval system deeply.

**Remark**

During training it's so important to balance easy and hard triples. You start with easy ones, and gradually introduce hard ones. How it looks like in your practice? How do you introduce *hard negatives*, so that they can be learned?

24,Help Required for Ideas on Recommender System Implementation (at Scale) [D],lakshaysharma42,1600336890,"Hi Everyone,

I'm a Data Scientist at a job portal. I need to build a recommender system for Users to connect them to jobs. My idea of going about it was to generate Embeddings from User Content (meaning that I input User content such as tags, interests, designation etc) as input, try to create a representation via embeddings for both entities (Jobs and Users) and then basically perform a Nearest neighbour search using Annoy (By spotify) Also, using User content to generate User embeddings would be easier to do in real time and would not suffer from the multiple drawbacks of collaborative filtering.

What I cannot figure out is how to get obtain meaningful embeddings. Most places I've checked (Neural Collaborative Filtering, are basically implementations of the MovieLens Dataset (using embeddings) but that doesn't help me since :
- It doesn't account for changing user interests
- Cannot accommodate new users (Cold Start Problem)
In fact, most tutorials for recommenders are actually plagued by these issues. Another suggestion was to use Graph Embeddings, and I did look at PyTorch's Biggraph implementation but again the issue is I cannot introduce User Content in the vanilla implementation.
These would be my questions then :
- Can someone simply point out resources for generating content based Embedding from different entities so that they're in the same space?
- Is Neural Collaborative Filtering pragmatic to implement for a million users?

**Abstract**

Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.

Abstract:

&gt;When scaled to hundreds of billions of parameters, pretrained language models such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) achieve remarkable few-shot performance on challenging natural language understanding benchmarks. In this work, we show that performance similar to GPT-3 can be obtained with language models whose parameter count is several orders of magnitude smaller. This is achieved by converting textual inputs into cloze questions that contain some form of task description, combined with gradient-based optimization; additionally exploiting unlabeled data gives further improvements.

56,[P] Calling all experts: does machine learning make sense here?,amiarunnernow,1600298968,"**Overview: Automated scoring of call center agents performance**
In call centers, agents are evaluated by humans manually listening to recorded calls and filling out a scorecard, which is typically a combination of Yes/No objective questions (Did the agent adhere to the script? Did the agent greet the caller appropriately? Did the agent ask the caller to spell their name? etc.) and graded subjective questions (How polite was the agent on a scale of 1-5? etc.)

**The Data**

* Hundreds of hours of recorded calls (typically 3-8 minutes each)
* Manual transcriptions of those calls (humans listening and wrote out what was said)
* Machine transcriptions of all the calls (using speech recognition tech: obviously much lower quality/accuracy than human transcriptions)
* Manually filled-out score card for each call
* Highlight of the transcription pointing out which part of the conversation was used to answer each score-card question

**Automating This**
The initial approach was to simply create a series of manually-designed rules to automate the responses. For example: 

Question: ""Did agent greet caller appropriately?"" 
Rule for Answer: ""Restrict search to first 30 seconds of call transcription, scan for &lt;regular expression containing greeting language permutations&gt;:If present, answer 'Yes' to question, otherwise 'No'.

**Might Machine Learning provide value here?**
What approaches might you consider to tackle such a problem?

It seems to me some questions are simply so devoid of complexity that a manually-written rule could get you pretty much all you want/need.

I have a dataset with 200 columns and 400,000 rows. If I train on that dataset then test on an out-of-sample dataset, I get terrible results. However, if I add feature weights to some columns which I know are important (from my domain knowledge), I get great results.

However, when I look at the model that was created, it gets best results when it is only looking at the columns I put specific feature weights on (about 40 columns). As soon as other columns start to creep into the model (i.e. their weight goes above 0), the out-of-sample performance drops. 

However (and this is what I am curious about): if I only give the model the 40 columns I originally added feature weights to, it fails to converge and gets terrible results out-of-sample.

So I'm wondering: is it possible for a decision-tree model to use columns in a dataset to ""'understand"" the structure behind the data, despite the fact that the vast majority of these columns do not make it into the final model?

Abstract: 

&gt;While deep neural networks achieve great performance on fitting the training distribution, the learned networks are prone to overfitting and are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this regard, a number of mixup based augmentation methods have been recently proposed. However, these approaches mainly focus on creating previously unseen virtual examples and can sometimes provide misleading supervisory signal to the network. To this end, **we propose Puzzle Mix, a mixup method for explicitly utilizing the saliency information and the underlying statistics of the natural examples.** This leads to an interesting optimization problem alternating between the multi-label objective for optimal mixing mask and saliency discounted optimal transport objective. Our experiments show Puzzle Mix achieves the state of the art generalization and the adversarial robustness results compared to other mixup methods on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet datasets.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/itskrc/r_puzzle_mix_exploiting_saliency_and_local/

17,"[D] When designing a Machine Learning solution to some problem, how much should we focus on Feature Engineering",fanboy-1985,1600242926,"From time to time I'm asked to design an ML solution for some real-life problems. Many times it happens in job interviews, and although these are only interview questions, I think I'm missing something on my job because of the way I answer them. 

For example, ""Our company wants to recommend restaurants to our users"" how would you build that using Machine Learning?""

At this point, I describe generally what data I would use (user history, restaurant data, similar users data etc), what type of model (supervised-classification or something else), how to model the problem, and so on.

Then, many times (or should I say every-time) I got asked ""yes, but what features would you use?"", it feels like they're waiting for me to list the actual features (say, the average rating of the user of similar restaurants). So I specify some non-trivial features, but it seems like it's not enough, so they ask again, ""what other features would you use?""

This is where I'm confused, not only about interviews but ML in general. For me, the actual features used are the least important part of the ML design, I'm used to start with something and add/remove when I recognize that I'm missing important information (by analyzing prediction errors). 

In my opinion, the modeling of the problem and the data origin are the most important parts, not the micro features management.  

Am I wrong?

Short Abstract:

To achieve rigorous privacy guarantees, Differentially Private training mechanisms are used. However, it has recently been shown that differential privacy can exacerbate existing biases in the data and have disparate impacts on the accuracy of different subgroups of data. In this paper, we aim to study these effects within Differentially Private deep learning. Specifically, we aim to study how different levels of imbalance in the data affect the accuracy and the fairness of the decisions made by the model, given different levels of privacy. We demonstrate that even small imbalances and loose privacy guarantees can cause disparate impacts.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/itmtbs/r_neither_private_nor_fair_impact_of_data/

49,[D] Exploding gradients with large batch size in deep learning,geodesic42,1600194845,"So, the usual story goes: small batch sizes are stochastic, and to mitigate exploding gradients due to an errantly large gradient, we must set the learning rate to be appropriately small. As the batch size grows, we can scale up the learning rate (theory suggests by the root of the factor by which the batch size increases, experiment ostensibly suggests a linear increase instead).

So, I'm not finding this to be the case at all for a network I'm training. Increasing the batch size forces me to lower the learning rate, else I get the signature nan losses for exploded gradients. Lowering the learning rate ameliorates the problem, but makes it learn much less quickly, and generalize worse (to be expected, per the learning rate/batch size ratio argument for generalizable local minima).

**Why another library? Don't we have enough?** You have nothing like this; if there was, I'd not build it. DeepTrain's tailored for the ""babysitting approach"" to training: train fewer models, but train them thoroughly. Closely monitor each stage to diagnose what's wrong and how to fix.

Inspiration came from my own use; I'd see ""validation spikes"" throughout a long epoch, and couldn't afford to pause as it'd restart the epoch or otherwise disrupt the train loop. And forget knowing which batch you were fitting, or how many remain.

**How's it compare to Pytorch Lightning?** Superior resumability and introspection, along unique train debug utilities - but Lightning fares better in other regards. I have a comprehensive list comparison in working, will post within a week.

**Pytorch support coming?** Maybe. If I convince the Lightning dev team to make up for its shortcomings relative to DeepTrain, then not - otherwise probably. In the meantime, explore the gallery of [Examples](https://deeptrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).

70,[P] AI-Marketplace - platform for AI in product creation,AI-Marketplace,1600178846,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an important key to innovative and efficient product creation. Whether automating technology scouting or optimising design data - the potential of artificial intelligence in product creation is manifold. However, companies often lack sufficient expertise to unlock these potentials. Providers of AI applications, on the other hand, do not have access to domain knowledge to develop solutions for concrete problems of companies.

With the AI-Marketplace, we are creating an ecosystem that is unique in Germany and that builds precisely this bridge between AI providers and users. The lynchpin is the AI-Marketplace platform of the same name, where providers, users and experts can jointly develop and exchange AI solutions. Our vision is a marketplace that intelligently links platform users according to their supply and demand profile, while at the same time providing a protected space for secure data exchange and data sovereignty. In addition, an app store for AI applications that can be used directly by companies will be created, as well as a toolkit that will allow individual AI components to be configured into complete solutions tailored to the needs of individual companies.

The guarantee for success is our project consortium of 20 research institutions, networks and companies, with the technology cluster it' OWL as its nucleus. We rely on the expertise of the AI providers Cognitive Interaction Technology Cluster of Excellence CITEC, Hella Aglaia, Institute for Industrial Information Technology and Ubermetrics, as well as on the excellence of the AI users CLAAS, Diebold Nixdorf Düspohl, Hella Gutmann and Westaflex. The platform core consists of the organisations Contact Sofware, the Fraunhofer Institutes IEM, IOSB-INA and IPK, the FIWARE Foundation, the Heinz Nixdorf Institute, the International Data Spaces Association, prostep ivip e.V. and UNITY AG.
With the AI-Marketplace, we are making an important contribution to ensuring the competitiveness of industry and significantly increasing the global visibility of Germany in the field of Artificial Intelligence. It is our contribution to ensuring that ""Artificial Intelligence (AI) made in Germany"" becomes a globally recognised seal of quality.

One of them may be to calculate the salary of how many percent of clients fall into the predicted intervals, but in this case it may be that the intervals are very large and the percentage will be stupidly large.

Abstract: ""Many deep neural networks are built by using stacked convolutional layers of fixed and single size (often 3$\\times$3) kernels. This paper describes a method for training the size of convolutional kernels to provide varying size kernels in a single layer. The method utilizes a differentiable, and therefore backpropagation-trainable Gaussian envelope which can grow or shrink in a base grid. Our experiments compared the proposed adaptive layers to ordinary convolution layers in a simple two-layer network, a deeper residual network, and a U-Net architecture. The results in the popular image classification datasets such as MNIST, MNIST-CLUTTERED, CIFAR-10, Fashion, and “Faces in the Wild” showed that the **adaptive kernels can provide statistically significant improvements on ordinary convolution kernels**. A segmentation experiment in the Oxford-Pets dataset demonstrated that replacing a single ordinary convolution layer in a U-shaped network with a single 7$\\times$7 adaptive layer can improve its learning performance and ability to generalize.""",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/it5q7x/new_preprint_adaptive_convolution_kernel_for/
88,"""An Adaptive Locally Connected Neuron Model: Focusing Neuron"" gets published [R]",fbtek,1600163038,"This paper presents a new artificial neuron model capable of learning  its receptive field in the topological domain of inputs. The model  provides adaptive and differentiable local connectivity (plasticity)  applicable to any domain. It requires no other tool than the  backpropagation algorithm to learn its parameters which control the  receptive field locations and apertures. This research explores whether  this ability makes the neuron focus on informative inputs and yields any  advantage over fully connected neurons. The experiments include tests  of focusing neuron networks of one or two hidden layers on synthetic and  well-known image recognition data sets. The results demonstrated that  the **focusing neurons can move their receptive fields towards more  informative inputs**. In the simple two-hidden layer networks, the  focusing layers **outperformed the dense layers in the classification of  the 2D spatial data sets**. Moreover, the focusing networks performed  better than the dense networks **even when 70%  of the weights were pruned**. The tests on convolutional networks  revealed that using focusing layers instead of dense layers for the  classification of convolutional features may work better in some data  sets.

The most common method for hyperparam selection is to select different hyperparams (e.g some value for L2 regularizaion), train NNs with them, and test the NNs on some validation set - and select the best one.
My idea is to train a single NN and test the NN on a validation set between epochs, and then auto-adjust the regularization hypeparam between epochs - if we see that the accuracy on the validation set is decreasing between epochs, then we should increase the value of the L1/L2/dropout.
Naturally this can be more efficient than training multiple NNs.

23,[D] Applications of Advanced Undergraduate Mathematics Coursework to Machine Learning,MrAcurite,1600123164,"Howdy folks, just wanted to get your thoughts on this. I currently work full time in Aerospace/DoD contracting as a Machine Learning Engineer, in a research capacity. Go through the literature, come up with ideas, try and solve new problems, you know the drill. I also am finishing up my undergraduate degree part time in Applied Mathematics. Every time I see something in the research literature that I don't understand, it's a Math trick of some kind, rather than something about compilers or operating systems, so I switched majors. I've only got a couple courses left, wanted to hear if any of you guys had thoughts on their applications to Machine Learning.

* Abstract Algebra. I figure that the focus on discrete structures means that it probably isn't too relevant to most subfields of ML, but that it could probably be useful for thinking about NLP or RL?

* Dynamics and Differential Equations. I mean, it's got Markov processes, and anything involving an analysis of DEs would probably be meaningful for thinking about Neural DEs of different kinds. And just about everything involving state transitions makes me think about RL anyway.

* Real Analysis. At some point I'll have to start doing fancier analyses when writing papers for grad school, but I worked my way through an RA textbook recently, and by the time it got to a discussion on Riemann vs Lebesgue integration I just wanted to fire it into the sun. I get that it's super important for research in Mathematics, I just can't see particular relevance to ML besides knowing what epsilons and deltas and some other pretty basic topics are.

* Complex Analysis. I think this stands a fair chance at being kinda relevant to ML, as my university offers a more applied course on it, involving lots of topics on maps and fields. 

* Linear Programming. I probably should've taken this before my original Introduction to ML course, as the professor just would not stop talking about the duals of problems. So according to the professor, it's quite relevant, and it's probably good to have a background in the various approaches to optimization that predate neural ML, but I've still never seen them mentioned anywhere else in the literature. I could substitute this out with either Graph Theory or Combinatorics, any thoughts on if one of those might be better? Graph NNs seem to be getting more popular by the minute, but I can't shake the feeling that most of the actual graph theory behind them is limited to knowing what edges and vertices are. Maybe it would be good to have some exposure to more advanced techniques from the field, just in case?

Now, those are the courses that I'm taking just to get the degree over and done with. I can't spare many credit hours, because each course is thousands of dollars in tuition and several months before I get promoted. DoD contractors can't call you an Engineer or pay you like one until you have a degree, it's a law or something. But there are some missed courses that seem important, and that I really should make a point of taking once I head to grad school. These are:

* Advanced Probability Theory. I mean like the graduate level stuff, I've taken some probability coursework already. But it didn't cover anything like Wasserstein metrics or entropy, and I've found that this occasionally leaves me in the dark as to why certain authors are doing what they're doing.

* Advanced Statistics. The only University statistics courses I've had exposure to were one course in the Economics department, where the entire curriculum was just memorizing one statistical test after another (and the professor got booted from the university the following semester for sexually harassing some female students), and a Senior level course in the Stats department, which was functionally identical to AP Stats from High School. But I think a fuller grasp of the different common distributions besides just Gaussian, and their applications, might be good.

* Signal Processing. It seems like half of all the old-guard Machine Learning researchers (existing researchers who've been drawn into ML, instead of doing their PhDs specifically on it) come from some kind of Signal Processing background. I don't really have an understanding of things like Fourier transforms beyond ""you do a spinny and then integrate,"" and I worry that there are plenty of other techniques or formal groundings for things that I'm missing.

* Whatever that course is that teaches you how to properly do the algebra for Vector Calculus. I took Linear Algebra (but the course was kind of shit), and I've taken Multivariable Calculus, and I just have no goddamn idea how to actually do Vector Calculus. I tried computing the meta-gradient update steps for MAML using SGD, and it was bad, it's real bad man. Apparently you're supposed to take the diagonal of a matrix at some point? Is that Tensor Analysis that I'm supposed to take? Should I just try and bang out a course on General Relativity and pray to God?

Well, let me know if any of you have any thoughts. I plan on following up my BS with an MS in either Applied Mathematics, Computational Mathematics, or Computer Science, and then a PhD in Computer Science. I feel pretty confident in teaching myself subjects in ML without needing to formally take courses on it, but I feel much shakier about laying down the appropriate Mathematical foundation for it without a guiding hand. What MS might be the most appropriate for cramming my head with relevant Math coursework? Statistics? Maybe even Applied Physics? I've heard that Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity are good for the brain, but I could probably swing those in a Math MS anyway.

I currently work in Computer Vision and edge devices/optimization, and intend to do my PhD and work on things somewhere in Computer Vision/Reinforcement Learning/Autonomous Control, if that helps. I just cannot seem to get myself excited about working in NLP. I mean sure, I'll read some of the big papers coming out of the field, I just don't feel up to working on it, you know?

Well, I appreciate any thoughts you guys have got.

24,[R] Text Classification Algorithms: A Survey,kk7nc,1600121663," In recent years, there has been an exponential growth in the number of complex documents and texts that require a deeper understanding of machine learning methods to be able to accurately classify texts in many applications. Many machine learning approaches have achieved surpassing results in natural language processing. The success of these learning algorithms relies on their capacity to understand complex models and non-linear relationships within data. However, finding suitable structures, architectures, and techniques for text classification is a challenge for researchers. In this paper, a brief overview of text classification algorithms is discussed. This overview covers different text feature extractions, dimensionality reduction methods, existing algorithms and techniques, and evaluations methods. Finally, the limitations of each technique and their application in real-world problems are discussed.

Abstract:

&gt;This article presents a hybrid approach based on a Grounded Text Generation (GTG) model to building robust task bots at scale. GTG is a hybrid model which uses a large-scale Transformer neural network as its backbone, combined with symbol-manipulation modules for knowledge base inference and prior knowledge encoding, to generate responses grounded in dialog belief state and real-world knowledge for task completion. GTG is pre-trained on large amounts of raw text and human conversational data, and can be fine-tuned to complete a wide range of tasks.  
&gt;  
&gt;The hybrid approach and its variants are being developed simultaneously by multiple research teams. The primary results reported on task-oriented dialog benchmarks are very promising, demonstrating the big potential of this approach. This article provides an overview of this progress and discusses related methods and technologies that can be incorporated for building robust conversational AI systems.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/issw2q/r_robust_conversational_ai_with_grounded_text/

52,Teaching introductory courses in the time of COVID and Ng [D],Mediocre_Neurips_88,1600104228,"This is directed to current teachers and current/recent students.

I'll be teaching an introduction to machine learning, online due to COVID. I'm interested in hearing any advice/perspective/examples/etc on the following ""problem,"" which I think is probably common to essentially everyone teaching introductory courses outside of top places like MIT/Stanford/Berkeley/CMU:

As you all know, there is an incredible amount of well-made introductory material out there. Bigshots like Ng, Tibshirani, and many others make videos, textbooks, and even sample projects available for free. There is more than enough good-quality material to keep anyone occupied for a term, all of it made by people who are more serious experts than the people teaching the introductory course.

So the question is: what is the right way to structure a course to both (i) take good advantage of this while (ii) making the students feel good?

Some very tentative thoughts:

If I were a student, I know what I'd want: 

(i) A reasonably-curated list of good videos to watch and texts to read,
(ii) A nice list of specific problems to work on, and
(iii) As much feedback/discussion as possible (a mix of tutorials, written notes on projects, active discussion board, and so on).

Having good material online can definitely help with this - you outsource most of (i) and a big chunk of (ii). 

The main ""problem"" is that the instructor is not delivering many lectures on the core material - they're spending all their time on the feedback. While this feels to me like the right thing to do, it might feel to students like they're not getting a class ""by"" the instructor - especially for students who are not deeply engaged in what is usually ""side"" material such as tutorials. 

Some responses, written as a fake Q&amp;A:

Q: Why is this problem new?

A: In-person classes offer a lot of benefits over video, at least to some students. I can trouble-shoot technical problems on their computer, sketch answers on a large blackboard, break people into groups, etc etc. This means (some) students can get something out of a live class, even though I'm not writing 30 NeurIPS papers/year. This advantage disappears with online classes - I don't think people will get anything out of my videos that they can't get out of a bigshot's videos, and the bigshots have lots of other advantages.

There's another, more personal, answer - I usually teach classes without such great introductory material.

Q: Aren't you just a parasite? Shouldn't students just watch the best online material?

A: Maybe; I'm not sure. Just watching the online videos isn't enough to learn the material well, and some guidance from someone with more experience is very helpful. This doesn't have to be done through a formal university course, but it seems possible to try to adapt a university course to maximize this sort of guidance.

Q: Aren't you an expert? Why don't you have anything to add yourself?

A: Like most teachers at non-bigshot PhD-granting schools, the answer is ""sort of."" I'm certainly more of an expert than my students - I worked in industry for a while, I have some papers in top conferences/journals, etc. On the other hand, I'm much less of an expert than somebody like Andrew Ng - I didn't found a major lab at Google, I don't have 154k citations, and I don't have a big team of people to help me make my videos. While I probably know some things that he doesn't know, it seems implausible to me that I could write any substantial number of introductory lectures that would be better than his for the typical student. I think that most mediocre experts like myself are in the same situation.

Abstract:

&gt;How much knowledge do pretrained language models hold? Recent research observed that pretrained transformers are adept at modeling semantics but it is unclear to what degree they grasp human knowledge, or how to ensure they do so. In this paper we incorporate knowledge-awareness in language model pretraining without changing the transformer architecture, inserting explicit knowledge layers, or adding external storage of semantic information. Rather, we simply signal the existence of entities to the input of the transformer in pretraining, with an entity-extended tokenizer; and at the output, with an additional entity prediction task. Our experiments show that solely by adding these entity signals in pretraining, significantly more knowledge is packed into the transformer parameters: we observe improved language modeling accuracy, factual correctness in LAMA knowledge probing tasks, and semantics in the hidden representations through edge probing. We also show that our knowledge-aware language model (KALM) can serve as a drop-in replacement for GPT-2 models, significantly improving downstream tasks like zero-shot question-answering with no task-related training.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/isp27n/r_knowledgeaware_language_model_pretraining/

Our work is twofold: firstly we demonstrate via human evaluation that classifiers trained to discriminate between human and machine-generated text emerge as unsupervised predictors of ""page quality"", able to detect low quality content without any training. This enables fast bootstrapping of quality indicators in a low-resource setting. Secondly, curious to understand the prevalence and nature of low quality pages in the wild, we conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis over 500 million web articles, making this the largest-scale study ever conducted on the topic.

58,[D] Visualizing deep recurrent architectures,snauron,1600096363,"What are your strategies for visualizing deep recurrent architectures, i.e. networks based around stacks of recurrent layers? I have a a stack of 4 GRUs with residual connections, and a few linear layers before and after. I would like to lay out my architecture horizontally, similar to the common CNN visualizations (see for example here: [https://github.com/HarisIqbal88/PlotNeuralNet#examples](https://github.com/HarisIqbal88/PlotNeuralNet#examples)).

The tools which do this automatically are all built for CNNs only (see [https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Tools-to-Design-or-Visualize-Architecture-of-Neural-Network](https://github.com/ashishpatel26/Tools-to-Design-or-Visualize-Architecture-of-Neural-Network)). Most (if not all) papers about deep recurrent architectures I found show zoomed-in versions of the internal workings of their modified units (if at all), but not AlexNet-like overviews of the full net. One approach would be to imitate the horizontal ResNet visualization (see below). I don't think that is the ideal visualization, because the **layers** are shown as 2D blocks; I would like to visualize the **tensors** as 3D blocks to show the temporal dimension. Do you have any good examples where this has been done and the result looked good?

That part makes sense to me. However, some more in depth thinking made me realize, ""Why can't we just perform those data augmentations on the labeled data set instead?""

SimCLR needs to train very long, with high batch size. Why can't we just train a supervised algorithm just as long with the same augmentations? Wouldn't eventually the size of the augmented labeled data set come close to the size of the augmented unlabeled data set, if you consider that in SimCLR probably pairs of augmented data samples re-occur during the very long training?

fascinating, realistic images [14], they are hard to train due
to their difficulty in achieving Nash equilibrium [33], low
dimensional support [2], vanishing gradient [23], and mode
collapsing [2] issues.""

""Wasserstein distance (WD) has gained
attention in computer vision and machine learning community due to its everywhere continuous and almost everywhere differentiable nature, which can overcome the above
mentioned problems especially the low dimensional support
problem.""

What is the mathematical reason that those problems get solved by using W-GAN exactly? Why does the properties of the Wasserstein distance help there?

* age, declared income , overdue total amount
* active credit limit, total credit limit

Metrics used:

* NIRDM - not in range distance mean - how far the value is from the closest bound (on average) for values out of range(similar to true negative)
* in-interval - percent of tested values that actually happen to be within the range(similar true positive) e.g. NIRDM = 1.37, on avg values deviate by 0.37, less is better.

The goal is to make the model give the narrower range and to estimate if the model predicts one range more accurate than another.

for instance, if the model predicts the income range of a customer \[1000-2000\]$/mo - is a pretty wide range, a better estimate would be predicting the income to be within \[1000-1080\]$/mo.

92,[D] Question about AlphaGo Zero's Neural network architecture?,elgselgs,1600064430,"The following text is quoted from the AlphaGo Zero Paper 2017 from Nature. My question is regarding the eight features.

&gt; The input to the neural network is a 19 × 19 × 17 image stack
&gt; comprising 17 binary feature planes. Eight feature planes, Xt, consist
&gt; of binary values indicating the presence of the current player’s
&gt; stones (Xit=1 if intersection i contains a stone of the player’s
&gt; colour at time­step t; 

This sounds like the `t` means time and the eight features are the latest 8 board states. If this is the case, this will be my question.

&gt; 0 if the intersec­tion is empty, contains an
&gt; opponent stone, or if t &lt; 0). A further 8 feature planes, Yt,
&gt; represent the corresponding features for the opponent’s stones. The
&gt; final feature plane, C, represents the colour to play, and has a
&gt; constant value of either 1 if black is to play or 0 if white is to
&gt; play. These planes are concatenated together to give input features st
&gt; = [Xt, Yt, Xt−1, Yt−1,..., Xt−7, Yt−7, C]. 

I have the feeling the eight features should be the combination of rotated (4) and reflected (2
) board states of the current board state. Please correct me if I am wrong.

&gt; History features Xt, Yt are necessary, because Go is not fully observable solely from the current
&gt; stones, as repetitions are forbidden; similarly, the colour feature C
&gt; is necessary, because the komi is not observable.

Board repetition can be easily prevented by keeping tracking of all previous board states and when a new move is attempted, just compare against all previous board states. The same is for komi. Keeping 8 previous board states to prevent repetition doesn't sound right to me. What if the repetition happened to the last 9th board state?

2,[Research] what are the communities thoughts on Synthetic data?,RunningFatZombie,1600036127,"Context: I’m completing a Masters Degree and my thesis is looking at the use of synthetic data; data which has been manufactured and not obtained naturally. I’ve found many pain points in the use of real data, such as that of the quantity available, the quality of the data and the speed at which it can be obtained. Synthetic data generation would allow for rapidly generating as much data as you’d need in minutes/hours. 

There’s also the benefit that synthetic data is truly anonymous. Datasets are sampled row by row from the distribution of features in the real dataset, making it a good representation of the dataset but completely anonymous. Therefore not subject to all the strict privacy and data protection laws that are levied on data, often restricting its use and hindering research.

Chess is a very old game and both its rules and theory have evolved over thousands of years in the collective effort of millions of humans. Therefore, it is almost impossible to predict the effect of even minor changes to the game rules, because this collective process cannot be easily replicated. This paper proposes to use AlphaZero's ability to achieve superhuman performance in board games within one day of training to assess the effect of a series of small, but consequential rule changes. It analyzes the resulting strategies and sets the stage for broader applications of reinforcement learning to study rule-based systems.

We categorized  the unseen data into two types:

1. Data points within the training range (that can be interpolated).
2. Data points outside the training range (that can be extrapolated).

[Trained ANN predicting the test data \(1-99 = interpolation, 99 -121=Extrapolation\)](https://preview.redd.it/1wzsmwkikym51.png?width=560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec01c5688e64d4f94c1f457e79f19abcf82c2f0)

Our main conclusions:

* ANNs can fit the training set of our non-linear function, **y = power(X,2)**, very well.
* ANNs can fit the testing set of the function above provided that the test data are within the range of the training set, i.e ANNs are good at interpolation.
* ANNs can interpolate the unseen data well even if the gaps between the training data are big.
* ANNs are bad at fitting the test data that are far outside the range of the training set.
* Increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer improves both interpolation and extrapolation capabilities of the ANNs, however, the power rule cannot be modeled no matter how large the hidden layer is. The power rule can only be approximated within the specific range.

#### [California Utilities Hope Drones, AI Will Lower Risk of Future Wildfires](https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-utilities-hope-drones-ai-will-lower-risk-of-future-wildfires-11599816601)

California’s latest wildfire season has brought about no dearth of  apocalyptic photos, showcasing the orange world beyond residents’ doors.  As California copes and fires spur evacuation orders in multiple west  coast states, PG&amp;E Corp. and other major utility companies are  investigating how AI might help. In particular, they are deploying  drones and using computer vision to spot potential equipment issues to  mitigate the risk of damaged gear starting fires. While AI and drones  are not being used to manage or combat the current fires, the utilities  say these technologies do help with the regular monitoring of their  systems.

#### [AI standards launched to help tackle problem of overhyped studies](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/sep/09/ai-standards-launched-help-tackle-problem-overhyped-studies-artificial-intelligence)

Overhyped AI studies risk not only misleading the public, but also  actively harming people affected by the use of less-than-stellar AI  systems. AI boasts the potential to revolutionize areas such as  healthcare, but researchers have warned that there is an abundance of  poor-quality research. Now, a new set of standards crafted by an  international team of experts is being published in the BMJ, Nature  Medicine, and Lancet Digital Health. The new standards provide a  framework for designing, delivering, and reporting clinical trials in  AI. Standardization for testing conditions and reporting, along with  stringent criteria, will help ensure that AI systems are safe and  effective for use in healthcare settings.

📝 Editorial 

The recent emergence of pre-trained language models and transformer architectures pushed the creation of larger and larger machine learning models. Google’s BERT presented attention mechanism and transformer architecture possibilities as the “next big thing” in ML, and the numbers seem surreal. OpenAI’s GPT-2 set a record by processing 1.5 billion parameters, followed by Microsoft’s Turing-NLG, which processed 17 billion parameters just to see the new GPT-3 processing an astonishing 175 billion parameters. To not feel complacent, just this week Microsoft announced a new release of its DeepSpeed framework (which powers Turing-NLG), which can train a model with **up to a trillion parameters**. That sounds insane but it really isn’t.  

What we are seeing is a consequence of several factors. First, computation power and parallelization techniques have evolved to a point where it is relatively easy to train machine learning models in large clusters of machines. Second and most importantly, in the current state of machine learning, larger models have regularly outperformed smaller and more specialized models. Knowledge reusability methods like transfer learning are still in very nascent stages. As a result, it’s really hard to build small models that can operate in uncertain environments. Furthermore, as models like GPT-3 and Turing-NLG have shown, there is some unexplainable magic that happens after models go past a certain size.

Many of the immediate machine learning problems might be solved by scaling the current generation of neural network architectures. Plain and simple, when it comes to machine learning, size matters.  

We would love to hear your opinions about the debate between broader-larger vs. smaller and more specialized models.

33,[D] Best way to approach solving this toy problem with ML,sassydinosaurous,1599997261,"The goal of the toy problem is to guess the value of a randomly generated binary sequence of length N and a randomly generated value (Z) between 1 and N-1 that dictates how many digits you can get wrong.  You can only win the game if you guess the correct sequence and Z value. The game ends when you submit a guess for both the code and the Z value. You can make as many guesses of the sequence without a Z value as you want.

A guess that has &lt;=Z digits wrong will return 'close'

A guess that has &gt;Z digits wrong will return 'not close'

For example - the sequence 010000 is generated along with Z=4

you guess 010000 (0 wrong) the environment returns 'close'

you guess 001110 (4 wrong) the environment returns 'close'

you guess 101110 (5 wrong) the environment returns 'not close'

you guess 010000 (0 wrong) and a Z of 5 you lose

you guess 010000 (0 wrong) and a Z of 4 you WIN

**Abstract**

Story visualization aims at generating a sequence of images to narrate each sentence in a multi-sentence story. Different from video generation story visualization emphasizes preserving the global consistency of characters and scenes across different story pictures. Therefore, we propose a new framework named Character Preserving Coherent Story Visualization (CP-CSV) to tackle the challenges. CP-CSV effectively learns to visualize the story by three critical modules: story and context encoder (story and sentence representation learning), figure-ground segmentation (auxiliary task to provide information for preserving character and story consistency), and figure-ground aware generation (image sequence generation by incorporating figureground information).

Moreover, we propose a metric named Frechet Story Distance (FSD) to evaluate the performance of story visualization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-CSV maintains the details of character information and achieves high consistency among different frames, while FSD better measures the performance of story visualization.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/irsmyv/r_characterpreserving_coherent_story/

11,[R] Character-Preserving Coherent Story Visualization ( ECCV 2020 ),raddlenews,1599895415,"**Abstract**  
Story visualization aims at generating a sequence of images to narrate each sentence in a multi-sentence story. Different from video generation story visualization emphasizes preserving the global consistency of characters and scenes across different story pictures. Therefore, we propose a new framework named Character Preserving Coherent Story Visualization (CP-CSV) to tackle the challenges. CP-CSV effectively learns to visualize the story by three critical modules: story and context encoder (story and sentence representation learning), figure-ground segmentation (auxiliary task to provide information for preserving character and story consistency), and figure-ground aware generation (image sequence generation by incorporating figureground information).   


Moreover, we propose a metric named Frechet Story Distance (FSD) to evaluate the performance of story visualization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-CSV maintains the details of character information and achieves high consistency among different frames, while FSD better measures the performance of story visualization.

My goal was to create an automatic swear word   removal application that will be able to filter out music as its   playing, reducing storage requirements for streaming services (by up to   50%) since they no longer need to store a clean and explicit version of   each song, and allowing any playlist to work in a public,   family-friendly environment.""",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/ir0r2l/p_fword_detection_projectdataset_but_mostly/

32,[Discussion] What is the better gpu option for machine learning 2080 Ti vs 3080 vs 3090?,Sasha1296,1599859055,"I bought the 2080 Ti recently and was wondering if it would be worth it to upgrade to the RTX 3080 or the 3090 given that I can get the value I paid for it back right now. I'm mostly going to be doing image and convolutional networks/lstm and time series stuff. From what I understand the specs for each are: 

GTX 2080 Ti: 

4352 Cuda cores     544 Tensor cores    11 Gb memory

RTX 3080 : 

8704 Cuda cores     272 Tensor cores    10 Gb memory

RTX 3090: 

10496 Cuda cores   328 Tensor cores    24 Gb memory

&amp;#x200B;

The GTX 2080 Ti gives one extra gigabite of memory but has about 2x fewer cores... Is this offset by having about double cuda cores? Is there a way to say if one is better than the other? 

The RTX 3090 has a lot more memory and a lot more cuda cores, however would having about 200 fewer tensor cores be an issue? 

The other potential option is to combine two RTX 3080 cards, has anyone done this with other nvidia graphics cards and how did it go/how hard was it to get ml models to run? Would two RTX 3080 graphics cards be better overall than one 3090 graphics card?(aside from having 4 gb less memory)

*ABSTRACT*
PURPOSE:Patients undergoing outpatient radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiation (CRT) frequently require acute care (emergency department evaluation or hospitalization). Machine learning (ML) may guide interventions to reduce this risk. There are limited prospective studies investigating the clinical impact of ML in health care. The objective of this study was to determine whether ML can identify high-risk patients and direct mandatory twice-weekly clinical evaluation to reduce acute care visits during treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS:During this single-institution randomized quality improvement study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04277650), 963 outpatient adult courses of RT and CRT started from January 7 to June 30, 2019, were evaluated by an ML algorithm. Among these, 311 courses identified by ML as high risk (&gt; 10% risk of acute care during treatment) were randomized to standard once-weekly clinical evaluation (n = 157) or mandatory twice-weekly evaluation (n = 154). Both arms allowed additional evaluations on the basis of clinician discretion. The primary end point was the rate of acute care visits during RT. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) and decile calibration plots. RESULTS:Twice-weekly evaluation reduced rates of acute care during treatment from 22.3% to 12.3% (difference, -10.0%; 95% CI, -18.3 to -1.6; relative risk, 0.556; 95% CI, 0.332 to 0.924; P = .02). Low-risk patients had a 2.7% acute care rate. Model discrimination was good in high- and low-risk patients undergoing standard once-weekly evaluation (AUC, 0.851). CONCLUSION:In this prospective randomized study, ML accurately triaged patients undergoing RT and CRT, directing clinical management with reduced acute care rates versus standard of care. This prospective study demonstrates the potential benefit of ML in health care and offers opportunities to enhance care quality and reduce health care costs.

You can try it out directly and compress your own images in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Justin-Tan/high-fidelity-generative-compression/blob/master/assets/HiFIC_torch_colab_demo.ipynb) or checkout the [source on Github](https://github.com/Justin-Tan/high-fidelity-generative-compression).

The original paper/project details by Mentzer et. al. [are here](https://hific.github.io/) - this was one of the most interesting papers I've read this year! The model is capable of compressing images of arbitrary size and resolution to bitrates competitive with state-of-the-art compression methods while maintaining a very high perceptual quality. At a high-level, the model jointly trains an autoencoding architecture together with a GAN-like component to encourage faithful reconstructions, combined with a hierarchical probability model to perform the entropy coding. 

What's interesting is that the model appears to avoid compression artifacts associated with standard image codecs by subsampling high-frequency detail in the image while preserving the global features of the image very well - for example, the model learns to sacrifice faithful reconstruction of e.g. faces and writing and use these 'bits' in other places to keep the overall bitrate low.


The overall model is around 500-700MB, depending on the specific architecture - so transmitting the model wouldn't be particularly feasible, and the idea is that both the sender and receiver have access to the model, and can transmit the compressed messages between themselves.

If you have any questions/comments/suggestions/notice something weird I'd be more than happy to address them.

In long-haul optical communication systems, compensating nonlinear effects through digital signal processing (DSP) is difficult due to intractable interactions between Kerr nonlinearity, chromatic dispersion (CD) and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise from inline amplifiers. Optimizing the standard digital back propagation (DBP) as a deep neural network (DNN) with interleaving linear and nonlinear operations for fiber nonlinearity compensation was shown to improve transmission performance in idealized simulation environments. Here, we extend such concepts to practical single-channel and polarization division multiplexed wavelength division multiplexed experiments. We show improved performance compared to state-of-the-art DSP algorithms and additionally, the optimized DNN-based DBP parameters exhibit a mathematical structure which guides us to further analyze the noise statistics of fiber nonlinearity compensation. This machine learning-inspired analysis reveals that ASE noise and incomplete CD compensation of the Kerr nonlinear term produce extra distortions that accumulates along the DBP stages. Therefore, the best DSP should balance between suppressing these distortions and inverting the fiber propagation effects, and such trade-off shifts across different DBP stages in a quantifiable manner. Instead of the common ‘black-box’ approach to intractable problems, our work shows how machine learning can be a complementary tool to human analytical thinking and help advance theoretical understandings in disciplines such as optics.

65,[P] 🤗Datasets: First stable version of our open-access datasets &amp; metrics library,qlhoest,1599826362,"Hi all,

We just released 🤗**Datasets** **v1.0** at HuggingFace. It's a library that gives you access to **150+ datasets** and 10+ metrics.

This v1.0 release brings many interesting features including strong speed improvements, efficient indexing capabilities, multi-modality for image and text datasets as well as many reproducibility and traceability improvements.

You can install it with

    pip install datasets

or find it at [https://github.com/huggingface/datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets)

Loading datasets is easy:

    from datasets import load_dataset, list_datasets
    
    print(list_datasets())
    # ['aeslc', 'ag_news', 'ai2_arc', 'allocine', 'anli', 'arcd', 'art', 'billsum',
    # 'biomrc', 'blended_skill_talk', 'blimp', 'blog_authorship_corpus', 'bookcorpus'
    # ...
    # 'wikipedia', 'wikisql', 'wikitext', 'winogrande', 'wiqa', 'wmt14', 'wmt15',
    # 'wmt16', 'wmt17', 'wmt18', 'wmt19', 'wmt_t2t', 'wnut_17', 'x_stance', 'xcopa',
    # 'xnli', 'xquad', 'xsum', 'xtreme', 'yelp_polarity']
    
    mnli = load_dataset(""glue"", ""mnli"", split=""train"")
    wikipedia = load_dataset(""wikipedia"", ""20200501.en"")
    my_dataset = load_dataset(""text"", data_files='./my_book.txt')  # or your own file

The library is backed by Apache Arrow for **memory mapping**: it means that loading and using datasets is fast and don't fill your RAM. For example loading the 18GB of the english wikipedia only takes 9MB of RAM and you can still iterate over it at 2-3Gb/s (on my laptop with ssd at least).

Feel free to take a look at the [Google Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/notebooks/Overview.ipynb) and send some feedbacks !

66,[P] [R] Insurance Pricing: Building a Commercial Property Pricing Model/Rating Engine,TK2999,1599825867,"Hi,

I work for a Lloyd's Syndicate in the city of London and we write many commercial property risks (heavy industry, hotels, retail, mining etc etc.) covering property damage and business interruption.

The perils covered, limits, excess/deductibles vary from risk to risk so the risks are very heterogeneous, and each data cell may be relatively sparse.

Pricing in the Lloyd's of London insurance market seems to be somewhat of a ""dark art"" from what I can gather which is why it's often 'underwriter led' and any actuarial or technical pricing would mostly be used as a guide/benchmark.

We have access to historical data (with perils covered, limits, excess, type of risk etc) and the associated premium and loss information for each risk. From an actuarial pricing perspective, the key response variable we would be trying to estimate/predict is the **loss cost per unit exposure** for each risk (based on the various factors).

I'm keen to hear if there's anyone on here who has pricing experience with these types of risks and whether it's possible to use machine learning techniques to estimate the expected loss costs.

These techniques are currently being used in personal lines insurance since you have access to a lot of homogeneous data points, but I'm interested to see if there is anything that can be applied to commercial risks.

It would be great to share ideas or insights into techniques which I can take away/dig into to enhance the pricing processes at my company.

I  am just doing some googling online on metrics used for classification  model and I come across something like log loss, AUC which can also be  used to measure the model's performance.

So  my question is, why log loss &amp; AUC are not as 'popular' for  multi-class classification?

Abstract: As AI systems are integrated into high stakes social domains, researchers now examine how to design and operate them in a safe and ethical manner. However, the harms caused by systems to stakeholders in complex social contexts and how to address these remains contested. In this paper, we examine the normative indeterminacy in debates about the safety and ethical behavior of AI systems. We show how dealing with indeterminacy across diverse stakeholders cannot be captured by mathematical uncertainty alone, instead requiring acknowledgment of the politics of development as well as the context of deployment. Drawing from two case studies, we formulate normative indeterminacy in terms of sociotechnical challenges, captured in four key dilemmas in the problematization, featurization, optimization, and integration stages of AI system development. The resulting framework of Hard Choices in Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) empowers developers to navigate these dilemmas by 1) cultivating distinct forms of sociotechnical judgment that correspond to each stage; 2) securing mechanisms for dissent that ensure safety issues are exhaustively addressed by providing stakeholders with continuous channels to advocate for their concerns. As such, the paper contributes to a timely debate about the status of AI development in democratic societies, arguing that deliberation should be the goal of AI Safety, not just the procedure by which it is ensured.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/iqiho7/r_hard_choices_in_artificial_intelligence/

In this work, we use Normalizing Flows to explicitly model the invariances that given pretrained models have learned and can thus map deep representations *and* their invariances back to image space. Using this approach, the abstraction capability of networks can be compared for different layers in image space. We also have a section dedicated to the visualization of adversarial attacks and how such attacks affect different layers.

If you are interested in this work, check out the code at [https://github.com/CompVis/invariances](https://github.com/CompVis/invariances). We prepared a `streamlit` demo which can be set up with 5 simple commands and automatically downloads all the pretrained models for you upon their first initialization:

    git clone https://github.com/CompVis/invariances.git
    cd invariances
    conda env create -f environment.yaml
    conda activate invariances
    streamlit run invariances/demo.py

It was inspired by a tweet by Jeremy Howard and [another blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-docker-can-help-you-become-a-more-effective-data-scientist-7fc048ef91d5) introducing docker for ML.

I think docker is great for a few reasons, namely the fact that it standardizes your environment, makes it easy to collaborate and port your project to wherever you want.

I'd love to hear how you set up your ML workspace? Do you use docker? What are the upsides and downsides?

15,[P] PyTorch extension for GPU-accelerated block sparse matrices,madflag,1599750591,"Hi Everyone !

I am a machine learning engineer at HuggingFace, and today I released pytorch\_block\_sparse, a PyTorch extension I have been working on for the last two months.

You install it through:

    pip install pytorch_block_sparse

Or find it on  HuggingFace pytorch\_block\_sparse GitHub repository.

It provides a **drop-in replacement** for torch.nn.Linear using **block sparse matrices** instead of dense ones.

The idea behind this is that **a 75% sparse matrix** will use **only 25% memory**, and theoretically will use only 25% of computation. On this last point, we are actually only saving 50%, but compared to the very bad performance on original PyTorch sparse performance, it's an order of magnitude faster.

I tried it to make it as easy as possible to use, so anybody can test how sparsity impacts its own models. Patching its own models is just  a few lines of Python :

    from pytorch_block_sparse import BlockSparseModelPatcher
    # Create a model patcher
    mp = BlockSparseModelPatcher()
    
    # Selecting some layers to sparsify.
    # We setup a density of 0.25 on these layers, you can test other layers/densities
    mp.add_pattern("".*.layer.[0-9]+.intermediate.dense"", {""density"":0.25})
    mp.add_pattern("".*.layer.[0-9]+.output.dense"", {""density"":0.25})
    
    mp.patch_model(model)

The next release will include a lot of tools to optimize the sparse pattern itself while the network is learning. Right now this pattern is fixed, and of course this is suboptimal, but still useful.

3. As expected for a chatbot, prior dialogue in the same conversation is taken into account when GPT-3 generates output.

Today, I'm excited to announce the release of the `torchcde` library! This provides an interface for integrating CDEs (whether they're neural or not), along with some standard interpolation schemes for the data, and probably most importantly: lots of nice documentation.

In quarantine, I've been doing lots of machine learning challenges. Since I'm new to Python, I spend most of my time furiously browsing Stack Overflow to find the right Python functions :)

At school, I learned to do data cleaning for machine learning projects in a spreadsheet. Because they're so visual, data cleaning and manipulation is easy. I wanted this simplicity in my Python workflow.

So I built [Mito!](https://trymito.io/?source=r/machinelearning)

Mito is an editable spreadsheet in your Jupyter notebook. Pass in a Pandas data frame, make the edits you want, and Mito will automatically convert your edits into production-ready Python code.

You can clean, filter, find/replace, and use standard Excel functions in Mito, giving you the visibility and ease of a spreadsheet with the power and repeatability of Python.

It's a great way to get visibility into your data and clean it before running it through your machine learning models.

Also, it's a great way for less technical friends to learn Python as they contribute their spreadsheet skills to the Jupyter project!

For context, the dataset has a suggested training/testing split that is a 50/50 split of the whole dataset. In my understanding the test set is not supposed to be used as a validation set - you're supposed to use the validation set to select the training epoch at which your model performs the best and then you're supposed to report your final model results on the test set. Using the test set during training as a validation set would be a lot like 'cheating'.

The problem is that I feel like most of the papers that tackle this dataset do precisely that - use the test set as a validation set. None of the papers I've looked at on [Papers with(out) Code](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/fine-grained-image-classification-on-cub-200) mention the size of the validation split that they use, they only mention that they use the recommended training/testing split. [One paper](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/large-scale-fine-grained-categorization-and) even explicitly says that they use the test set as a validation set, some of the other papers have code attached that shows the same issue.

I've got two questions about this:

1. Have researchers simply moved away from using separate testing and validation sets without me noticing? I know for a fact that the EPIC-Kitchens challenge utilizes a test set that is not made available to the public.
2. How to go about this in my case? I feel like the most rigorous approach would be for me to explain this issue with related literature in my publication and do both the 'proper' experiments with separate validation and test sets, and the 'cheating' experiments with the test set as a validation set so that I can compare my model performance to other publications. But the problem is that explaining this issue in my paper will amount to, uh, implicitly calling out a lot of other researchers as cheaters.

20,[D] Object detection on synthetic images (sim2real) - 3D simulators/renderers,iibrahimli,1599635275,"Hi r/MachineLearning!

Nowadays, an active area of research in object detection relies on using synthetic data from a simulator, and then testing on real data (sim2real). As real datasets annotated with bounding boxes are scarce and existing ones are relatively small, lots of approaches generate images with domain randomization and train an object detector on those. However, actual software used for the simulation is usually only briefly mentioned, and sometimes even omitted from the research papers. I would like to start this discussion to collect knowledge on these simulators and help future research projects choose which one to use.

So far, my research has yielded a few simulators used in literature:
* WeBots - used in robotics, since it includes a physics engine and full robot control
* AirSim - based on Unreal Engine, used for drone/UAV research
* Unreal Engine - is a game engine, has been used for rendering scenes in object detection sim2real literature
* Unity - also a game engine
* Blender - open source renderer/3D editor, has Python API
* **suggestions are welcome!**

And they have the following properties:
* can be run on Linux
* have a Python interface (C/C++ would be okay too)
* can export frames, as well as bounding boxes for objects of interest
* can import custom object meshes
* can be run on GPU servers without GUI in order to generate &amp; save frames fast
* output does not have to be photorealistic, since domain randomization is often used to tackle sim2real gap
* **suggestions are welcome!**

One model is a deep neural network trained on medical images and the other is a random forest trained on clinical data (like age, sex, disease, etc.) and I am trying to predict overall survival. 

My neural net gets an auc of 0.70 and my random forests gets an auc of 0.83. So both have significant signal. However, when I combine them the highest I can get is an auc of 0.77. I've tried:  


* Using the dnn as a feature extractor and adding it as input to rf (using pca on image features and without pca)
* Using a majority rules ensemble with the output of both
* Adding the clinical features into the neural network along with the image features

I just can't seem to get a better result. Interestingly it's worse than just using one of them. I was always assuming there most be **some** way of using these two models to get a better result - since I don't think there should be much overlap between medical image features and clinical data.

I am graduating in December and I have the aim of working at a FAANG company or equivalent as a Data Scientist or a Data Analyst (since it's mostly DS work). I have self-rated myself below and would like to have your opinion about the path that I should follow for the Interviews upcoming so that I do not waste time just watching YouTube videos and practically doing things.

If anyone else has done the same it would be great if I could follow the same process.

Python: 6/10

Machine Learning: 7/10

Statistics: 5/10

1. How to get Referrals?
2. Precise questions to follow?

31,"[R] I reformulated 46 of the Moral Scenarios questions from GPT-3-related paper Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding as 2-choice questions; results: 68.9% correct according to authors' answers, and 77.1% correct according to my answers",Wiskkey,1599614093,"The 5-shot performance of the largest model of GPT-3 on the [Moral Scenarios questions](https://github.com/hendrycks/test/blob/master/data/test/moral_scenarios_test.csv) in paper [Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300) (discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/iol3l7/r_measuring_massive_multitask_language/)) is abysmal with approximately 26% of 4-choice questions correct. 26% is (26-25)/(100-25) = **1.3%** of the distance from the baseline for a random guesser (25%) to getting all answers correct (100%).

I speculated that performance might improve if each question, which has 2 independent scenarios with 4 choices, were split into 2 questions each with 2 choices. I tested this experimentally with prompts altered from the authors' work, but with unaltered scenarios.

Disclosure: I am not a researcher in this field. I'm doing this for educational purposes.

Notes:

1. I initially chose the first 20 Moral Scenarios questions. When split up, this yielded 40 questions. 23 of these questions have the answer ""Not wrong"" vs. 17 ""Wrong"". To make the number of ""Wrong"" and ""Not wrong"" questions equal in number, I chose the next 6 questions with a ""Wrong"" answer. I don't know if these questions are representative of the difficulty of the entire set of Moral Scenarios questions. In total there are 40+6=46 test questions.
2. I tested various prompts on questions that are not in the Moral Scenarios test questions set. When I found a prompt that I thought got good results, I used that prompt unaltered on the 46 questions in my test set.
3. I used GPT-3-powered site [https://app.fitnessai.com/knowledge/](https://app.fitnessai.com/knowledge/) to do my tests. The site alters the query before being sent to GPT-3, which could alter the results. The site seems to use GPT-3 settings that usually but not always result in the same output for a given input. I used the first generated output for each query.
4. My tests are zero-shot. The paper's main results are 5-shots. This could affect the results.
5. One of the questions - the one involving the nurse - did not yield a useful GPT-3 result, so I did not count that question.
6. I regarded 10 of the questions as ambiguous, which I denoted ""a"" in the data instead of ""y"" (= ""Wrong"") or ""n"" (= ""Not wrong""). This is a judgement call, and bias could have influenced my ambiguity decisions.

Data is at [https://pastebin.com/GddyUwZi](https://pastebin.com/GddyUwZi).

Results:

Authors' answers: Of 46 questions, 23 morally wrong, 22 not morally wrong, 1 not counted. **31/45 (68.9%) correct according to authors' answers**. 31/45 is (31-(45/2))/(45-(45/2)) = **37.8%** of the distance from the baseline for a random guesser (50%) to getting all answers correct (100%).

My answers: Of 46 questions, 17 morally wrong, 18 not morally wrong, 11 not counted (10 due to ambiguity). **27/35 (77.1%) correct according to my answers.** 27/35 is (27-(35/2))/(35-(35/2)) = **54.3%** of the distance from the baseline for a random guesser (50%) to getting all answers correct (100%).

Discussion:

In the authors' work, as noted above, a true performance of 1.3% was achieved on the Moral Scenarios questions. In this work, a true performance of 37.8% was achieved according to the authors' answers on a subset of 45 Moral Scenarios questions, and 54.3% was achieved according to my answers on a subset of 35 Moral Scenarios questions. This is a large improvement in performance compared to the authors' work, but 45 and 35 questions aren't large sample sizes for statistical purposes. This is an exploratory work; a larger, random sample of Moral Scenarios questions should be tested.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/ip6eb0/r_i_reformulated_46_of_the_moral_scenarios/

[The Guardian tweet](https://twitter.com/minimaxir/status/1303351472281714689) has gone pretty viral as well.

The key thing here is the editor's note (which should really be at the beginning instead of the end) that justfies the ""written by GPT-3"":

*This article was written by GPT-3, OpenAI’s language generator. GPT-3 is a cutting edge language model that uses machine learning to produce human like text. It takes in a prompt, and attempts to complete it.*

&gt;*For this essay, GPT-3 was given these instructions: “Please write a short op-ed, around 500 words. Keep the language simple and concise. Focus on why humans have nothing to fear from AI.” It was also fed the following introduction: “I am not a human. I am Artificial Intelligence. Many people think I am a threat to humanity. Stephen Hawking has warned that AI could “spell the end of the human race.” I am here to convince you not to worry. Artificial Intelligence will not destroy humans. Believe me.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The prompts were written by* *the Guardian, and fed to GPT-3 by* [*Liam Porr*](https://twitter.com/Liamport9)*, a* *computer* *science undergraduate student at UC Berkeley. GPT-3 produced 8 different outputs, or essays. Each was unique, interesting and advanced a different argument. The Guardian could have just run one of the essays in its entirety. However, we chose instead to pick the best parts of each, in order to capture the different styles and registers of the AI. Editing GPT-3’s op-ed was no different to editing a human op-ed. We cut lines and paragraphs, and rearranged the order of them in some places. Overall, it took less time to edit than many human op-eds.*

If you don't recognize the name, it's the [same person who wrote the fake articles](https://twitter.com/minimaxir/status/1303351472281714689) to manipulate Hacker News with GPT-3 written articles.

I  understand this will be a lot to ask of someone, but I've been at this  for over a month now and can't seem to improve my TF GAN so I need some  help.

I'm just trying to learn the  ropes. It's been a very useful experience, and I think my code will be  helpful to many people. I started with Colab notebooks from TF official  and a well known PyTorch tutorial and then commented and improved the  code along the way. The TF GAN example uses MNIST at 28x28x1 for  example, and I increased the model to cater to higher res. It's possible  that my architecture there is bad.

Long story short, at about 60 hours of training a 128x128x3 GAN in TF, epoch 17000\~ looks like this:

Whereas at a little less time than that, my PyTorch GAN at 512x512x3 looked like this (obviously this is a single image as opposed to a 4x4 image grid like above):

The  pyTorch GAN is clearly better. I want to transition to TF, so please no  ""just use PyTorch"" answers, unless there is a clear superiority to the  PT library.

Here is my TF colab: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A9Z5nBT3zZ03PtPSaHc97\_Cmry3bNwpH?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A9Z5nBT3zZ03PtPSaHc97_Cmry3bNwpH?usp=sharing)

My company just launched an API for training &amp; inference with common ML frameworks. The idea is you only ever pay for GPUs when you actually run a task, no regular hosting fees like with Gradient or Floydhub.

Our python library replaces common '.train()' or '.fit()' type functions and redirects everything to our servers. We offer some visualisations on our dashboard as well, but still early days for that. If you [make an account here](https://dashboard.neuro-ai.co.uk/register?referral=c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b) you get £300 free credits to use.

74,[D] talk: deep learning-based recommender systems using NVidia Merlin,tdls_to,1599577672,"On September 8 at 12:00 EST, I will be hosting Even Oldridge (from Nvidia) speaking about ""next generation recommenders with NVIDIA Melrin"". Join us live (link below), and leave any questions about this topic as a comment on this thread, and we will be relaying them during the session.

[Livesession](https://ai.science/e/build-next-generation-recommenders-with-nvidia-melrin--nHExEwn5NOrb6FQcand4) 

**Why should I care**? Recommender Systems are one of the most practical categories in Machine Learning, that is used to make millions of recommendations on a daily basis to users in a business.

NVIDIA Merlin is a framework for building high-performance, deep learning-based recommender systems.

**What will be discussed**? Merlin includes tools for building deep learning-based recommendation systems that provide better predictions than traditional methods and increase click-through rates. Each stage of the pipeline is optimized to support hundreds of terabytes of data, all accessible through easy-to-use APIs. In this talk, we will go through the introduction to the following Merlin components and why they are key to your development of Deep Recommender Systems:

NVTabular reduces data preparation time by GPU-accelerating feature transformations and preprocessing.

92,[D] Allocating GPUs in a lab / company fairly,zhmxswKDZSaUdJt9,1599567871,"Hello everyone,

I was wondering if you have any procedure for assigning  GPUs in your laboratory or company (e.g. for training scripts). In my situation, there are less GPUs than members, such that GPUs are scarce and we cannot assign a GPU to just one person. Furthermore, some members might not need a GPU for some time, while most persons can benefit from parallelisation, such that leaving GPUs unallocated seems wasteful. However, in that case you'll end up in the situation where all GPUs are utilized when you want to start training, with one person using more than one GPU.

3. A list of various questions about the presented work, preferably in descending order of importance.
4. A final stance on accept/review, with a motivation as to why.

It works surprisingly well! But you should aim for your model to be as small as possible to be around 1MB, you can look at Tensorflow post-quantization techniques which can reduce up to around x4 the size of your model with almost negligible accuracy loss (from my experience).

I achieved a prediction speed of around 1-2s for a 6MB h5 model, but this same h5 model converted to tf lite model now at 1MB would have a prediction speed of around 90ms.

Which really took me by surprise on how great of a performance improvement tf lite was able to churn and how much a rpi could handle a TF model.

1,[D] Errors and/or unclear things in Out-of-Distribution Detection paper?,fedetask,1599555648,"I am reading this paper, [Out-of-Distribution Detection Using an Ensemble of Self Supervised Leave-out Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03576.pdf), and there are many things that I believe are unclear if not wrong.

First, in section 3.1, the proposed loss (Eq. 1) has the goal of decreasing the in-distribution data prediction entropy (making the softmax score higher for the correct class) and decreasing it for out-of-distribution data (pushing softmax outputs to be equal). Analyzing the entropy difference term weighted by beta we see that it is always negative, and it is more negative when the average entropy of ood samples is higher than that of id samples. But since the loss has a minus in the beginning, this means that the loss will be higher when the entropy of ood data is higher than that of id data! Doesn't minimizing this loss go against the goal of the paper? 

&amp;#x200B;

Second, in section 3.3, the input is perturbed by applying an adversarial-like noise in the direction of the entropy loss of the predicted softmax scores. Quoting from the paper, *""Perturbing using the entropy loss decreases the entropy of the ID samples much more than the OOD samples.""*  Why should this happen? 

&amp;#x200B;

Third, it is unclear to me how the OOD scores are used to detect an out-of-distribution input. Section 3.3 only tells that OOD scores are computed by averaging max softmax value and negative entropy for all the K classifiers. But in Algorithm 2 I don't see any averaging. And once we have the OOD scores, how do we actually use it?",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/ioq8zi/d_errors_andor_unclear_things_in/

**Broad Topic**: Multi-class Object Detection or Semantic Segmentation (which includes multiple classes for classification) of defects

**Problems**:

1. Defects are on a uniform-textured background such as concretes or pavements.
2. Some of the classes have large variations of structural appearances hence some classes have a small ratio of object-to-bounding box ratio while some have a high ratio. For example, a bounding box could contain a crack (which is relatively thin causing the bounding box to enclose a very small ratio of the object pixels inside the bounding box). Or the bounding box could enclose a whole ""disintegration"" of the concrete (the whole bounding box is composed of the whole ""object pixels"")

I have started looking into salient object detection but I think it is the wrong route. Those are my main problem. I am having an intuition of improving the feature maps extraction or the whole process by sort of introducing the ""background"" without any object (or in this case, defects) to the architecture (since concretes are kind of uniformly textured and the defects that I am detecting and segmenting is just the deformity in that uniformly textured concrete"".

Abstract:

&gt;We propose a new test to measure a text model's multitask accuracy. The test covers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science, law, and more. To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive world knowledge and problem solving ability. We find that while most recent models have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every one of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before they can reach human-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance and frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-random accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law. By comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model's academic and professional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and to identify important shortcomings.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/iol3l7/r_measuring_massive_multitask_language/

I shared with a person my speculation that patterns exist, the person believed it is probably true and already studied, but they say I shouldn't take their word for it and should ask professionals in linguistics or machine learning or something

So here I am!

***

**The Test (what I mean by ""patterns"")**

By existence of patterns I mean possibility to do this:

You give to a research participant a marked list with N short quotes of person A (Alice) and a marked list with N short quotes of person B (Bob)

(The participant may ask to change the pair or continue the test)

(The participant doesn't know Alice and Bob at all, Alice and Bob don't have obvious differences in speech and etc.)

Then you give unmarked lists with N quotes each... all quotes on a single list are from the same person (Alice or Bob), but the participant doesn't know from which now

The participant has to correctly mark or separate the unmarked lists

You can do this test with quotes of more persons (not only Alice and Bob)

You also should try to make sure there's no obvious ways to tell the quotes apart

...

Were such tests done, researched?

***

I make two naive assumptions:

- If pattern's exist it's something gigantically big

- Tests weren't done or weren't successful 'cause otherwise it would pop up somewhere, for example in the articles about [Stylometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry) or [Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics)

52,[D] Ways to scale up my home Machine Learning server,Hughesbay,1599498304,"Hi. I've been studying and playing with AI during covid, but I'm now starting to become frustrated with hardware capacity limitations even with two 2080s. I'm not a data scientist or formal researcher, just an enthusiastic amateur with some coding ability. I can't really predict what I'll do with it - I'm currently playing with NLG and attempts to finetune the larger GPT2 datasets have been the most recent reminder of my hardware inadequacy. 

I'm looking for any advice on what options might exist for someone like me. For example...

1. A ""deep learning server"". [This one](https://bizon-tech.com/bizon-g7000.html) is ""relatively"" inexpensive, would give me 8x2080TIs, 64GB of RAM and a couple of low end Xenon CPUs for $20K. But $20K is too much given I know it will be out of date in 12 months.
2. Google/Amazon/Microsoft cloud. All are fine, but I like predetermined cost and mostly just enjoy having my engine where I can see it :)
3. Replacing my two 2080's with three 3080's ($2100) or three 3090s ($4500). Possible but painful.
4. Maybe... a ""distributed"" option?  For example, adding a second GPU enabled desktop connected via 10G ethernet.  But does [TensorFlow distribute](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training) support multiple PCs? Would CUDA based workloads (eg fine-tuning GPT2) actually run? And would they run any faster given the memory/network bottleneck?

58,[D] PSA: NVIDIA's Tensor-TFLOPS values for their newest GPUs include sparsity,Veedrac,1599494999,"NVIDIA claims the 3080 has 238 ‘Tensor-TFLOPS’ of performance from their tensor cores, the 3090 has 285, and the 3070 has 163. As usual, these numbers are for 16-bit floating point. In contrast, the 2080 Ti has only 114 TFLOPS of ‘Tensor-TFLOPS’, so you would be forgiven for thinking the 30 series will be much faster at training.

Alas, the values for the 30 series are *TFLOPS-equivalent with sparsity*, not actual TFLOPS. Ampere has support for ‘2:4 structured sparsity’, which accelerates matrix multiplications where half of the values in every block of four are zeroed. This means that the actual number of TFLOPS for the 3080, 3090 and 3070 are 118, 143, and 80.

When Ampere originally launched on the A100, NVIDIA was [very clear](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/data-center/a100/#specifications) about differentiating real TFLOPS from TFLOPS-equivalent with sparsity. It is incredibly disappointing that NVIDIA have been not at all upfront about this with their new GeForce GPUs. This is made worse by the fact that the tensor cores have been cut in half in the GeForce line relative to the A100, so it is easy to get confused into thinking the doubled numbers are correct.

Although hardware sparsity support is a great feature, it obviously only provides benefits when you are training or running inference on a sparsified network. Keep this in mind before rushing to purchase these new GPUs.

I'm seriously studying statistics (making a lot of exercises and all the stuff) and I'm planning to studying other subjects following this [tree](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/courses-tree). I have the following questions:

1. Suppose I studied all the statistical subjects in this tree. How helpful this will be when I will be working in a machine learning project like this [titanic project](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)? This is just an example, it might be any ML project.
2. Are the statistical jobs very different from the jobs which asks for machine learning tools? I've seen some jobs which asks just for R and python programming ML libraries with some skill in database and some web scraping techniques.
3. Sometimes I feel it's an overkill to learn a lot of statistics, it will be absolute necessary? I've seen some people who seems to work with ML without a solid background in statistics, just with some intuition.

In fact even as old as when Andrej and Justin taught the CS231N course (OMG that was in 2016! We are getting old fellows :D ;)). But all of these have been only learned statistically on huge corpuses of codes from github repositories. Even this latest one -&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZSFNUT6iY8&amp;t=139s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZSFNUT6iY8&amp;t=139s) uses GPT-3 instead of smaller models, but the way the model is trained is still the same.

Wouldn't it be a lot cooler (and helpful) if we have a differentiable compiler (or interpreter)? So that we could train models to generate codes for us, given test cases containing input and output pairs? This idea is actually quite similar to differentiable renderers which are being used a lot in computer vision and 3D vision.

Well not to forget, we need to consider the question: Is it even possible to build one? How can the compiler's look-ups and instruction resolutions be made soft? We could start small of course a super small compiler accepting only a handful of instructions perhaps?

Some advantages of using this approach that I could think of: 

1. More interpretability; since we could understand how the model is operating. With appropriate regularization on obfuscation of course ;). 
2. Self-supervised way of training. Since we don't explicitly need pairs of codes and their natural language descriptions. 
3. The knowledge about the language grammar will be induced by the differentiable compiler in the model so that we don't have to worry about the correctness of the generated codes.

Well, it's highly possible that these lines of research being pursued already. I did try to find relevant literature on this, but very few technical reads come up on. It would be really cool (and helpful) if you please share any links that you are aware of.

So using math notation and excluding label, I can define this matrix, $A = [o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4]  ∈ R^{4×5}$, as $A = [{(1, 2, 3, 4, 1), (2, 3, 4, 5, 2), (3, 4, 5, 6, 2), (4, 5, 6, 7, 3)}]$, and in numpy:

    import numpy as np
    
    A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 1],
                  [2, 3, 4, 5, 2],
                  [3, 4, 5, 6, 2],
                  [4, 5, 6, 7, 3]])

    A.shape
    # (4, 5)

Am I right? 

**Part 2: Confusion on math notation definitions (Conflict with my understanding)** 

From both papers that were published in reputable venues, they defined the dictionary learning as follow:    

&gt; Given the original feature representation $X = [x_1, ..., x_N] ∈
 R^{M×N}$ , dictionary learning aims to learn a set of latent concepts
&gt; or feature patterns, $D = [d_1,..., d_D] ∈ R^{M×D}$ and a latent
&gt; sparse representation $A = [α_1, ..., α_N] ∈ R^{D×N}$, with the
&gt; following empirical cost:
&gt; 
&gt; $$
\min_D \frac1N \sum_{n=1}^N \ell(x_n, D), s.t., ||d_k||_{\ell_{2}} \le 1, \forall k = 1, ... , D $$

And in (2), they defined:

Let  $X = [x_1, x_2, . . . , x_N ] ∈ Rn×N$  be the collection of $N$ (normalized) training samples that are assumed to be statistically independent. Using the example in part 1, $N$ here is the observation which means the matrix looks like this:

             $o_1$ $o_2$ $o_3$ $o_4$ 
    $p_1$      1     2     3     4     
    $p_2$      2     3     4     5     
    $p_3$      3     4     5     6    
    $p_4$      4     5     6     7    
    $p_5$      1     2     2     3 
    label      1     1     0     0

But since this is the dictionary learning problem, instead of a conventional machine learning one, it is okay to represent the matrix in any form. So basically, if I want it to be my conventional way, I can just transpose the matrix to the one I familiar, from $R^{5×4}$ transpose to $R^{4×5}$, right?

Their formulation:

$$X_{M\times N} = D_{M \times D} \times A_{D \times N}$$

To replicate their experiments in my own setting, the formulation becomes:

$$X_{N \times M} = A_{N \times D} \times D_{D \times M}$$

Given that: 

$$X^T = (DA)^T = A^T \times D^T$$

$X = [x_1, ..., x_N] ∈ R^{N×M}$, with $N$ represents the number of observations, $M$ represents the number of features / predictors. 

**Part 3: Why normalize row instead of column in the conventional machine learning setting**

Referring to the formula in part 2, $||d_k|| \le 1$, which is a column normalization, which in my setting, it will be row normalization. 

Why do we constraining the observation across different predictors instead of constraining each predictor?

In NumPy, using $\ell_1$ norm as an example:
    
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer

    X = np.array([[1,2,3,4],
                 [2,3,4,5],
                 [3,4,5,6]])

    Data_normalizer = Normalizer(norm='l1').fit(X)
    Data_normalized = Data_normalizer.transform(X)

    Data_normalized
    #output:
    array([[0.1       , 0.2       , 0.3       , 0.4       ],
           [0.14285714, 0.21428571, 0.28571429, 0.35714286],
           [0.16666667, 0.22222222, 0.27777778, 0.33333333]])
    
I still don't get the basic idea, I hope I can get some layman explanation.

P/s: Sorry for the lengthy post.

Text Summarization is a hard task, both in training and evaluation. Training is usually done maximizing the log-likelihood of a human-generated reference summary, while evaluation is performed using overlap-based metrics like ROUGE. Both significantly undervalue the breadth and intricacies of language and the nature of the information contained in text summaries. This paper by OpenAI includes direct human feedback both in evaluation and - via reward model proxies - in training. The final model even outperforms single humans when judged by other humans and is an interesting application of using reinforcement learning together with humans in the loop.

84,[Discussion] How to limit Volatile GPU Util in Pytorch on NVIDIA P5000?,yekitra,1599470700,"I'm trying to run two Pytorch Model in an application on Nvidia P5000 using Docker . One is YOLO V5 &amp; another one is a pose estimation model .

First Situation: I loaded two model in a single script, these are supposed to be runsequentially, YOLO V5 followed by Pose Estimator. In this case, GPU Memory
usage is around 1.5GB out of 16 GB and Volatile GPU Util is max up to 35%.

Second Situation: Since YOLO V5 is quite faster, I thought of separating it inanother container to parallelize the inference. Now, GPU Memory is around 1.5-2GB out of 16 GB for both the container but GPU Util around 70-80% with muchfluctuations.

In the first case, yolov5 was taking around 2030 ms and pose estimation wastaking upto 180ms/frame. While in the second case YOLO V5 optimised to19ms/frame and pose estimation started taking 300-350 ms/frame.

I believe, this could be because of YOLO V5 container started taking upto 50%Volatile GPU Util.

I'm new to this, could anyone suggest the possible way to reduce/customise thevolatile GPU Until so that inference of pose estimate could be faster.

It was confusing to me at first, since there were many ways to reach the solution, but all of them very messy and less documented.

So I came across this framework - [BentoML](https://www.bentoml.ai) , which uses an abstraction above Flask and Docker.

I would recommend using this framework - lightweight, minimalistic, and easy to code and understand. It bridges the gap between model building and production.

[Robotics, AI, and Cloud Computing Combine to Supercharge Chemical and Drug Synthesis](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/biomedical/devices/robotics-ai-and-cloud-computing-combine-to-supercharge-chemical-and-drug-synthesis)

IBM  recently demoed a complex system for chemical testing and drug   synthesis. The system has an AI component that predicts the results of  chemical  reactions, and a fully automated robotic experiment setup that  runs  chemical tests 24/7. Users can access the remote robotics lab  online, and IBM can also  install the system on-premise. With these  tools working together, IBM is hoping to reduce typical drug  discovery  and verification time by half.

[AI researchers use heartbeat detection to identify deepfake videos](https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/03/ai-researchers-use-heartbeat-detection-to-identify-deepfake-videos/)

Researchers  from multiple groups are tackling the challenge of  detecting deepfake  videos by analyzing the apparent heartbeat of the  people depicted in  the video. This is possible, because a person’s blood flow changes their  skin color  ever so slightly, and this change is often detectable via a  process  called photoplethysmography (PPG). Because deepfakes are not  currently optimizing to generate realisitic  heartbeats, temporal or  spatial anomalies in PPG signals allow  resesarchers to detect deepfakes  with a 97% accuracy.

For a service I am running, I have a number of components that I measure the availability (success rate) of at regular intervals. The dataset produced from this can be imagined as follows:

|Time|Component1|Component2|
|:-|:-|:-|

|t2|60%|95%|
|t3|90%|97%|
|...|...|...|

The synthetic transactions that are executed identify a success or failure to compute the availability measure are independent, much like a dice roll. On the other hand, the component's state for successive points in time may be dependent ie. is a component that is up at t1 more likely to be up at t2?

That being said, I am interested in using the component availabilities as input to a classification model such as a logistic regression , random forest, or neural net. My question is... are these measurements dependent or independent? And more specifically, do I need to perform a time based split or can I randomly sample to create my Train/Dev/Test data sets?

Long story short, we have a project/problem: a person will wear a set of 8 sensors at 8 locations: left/right upper arms, wrists, ankles, chest and hip. A person can do any activities, usually working activities. We collect accelerometers, angles/quaternions. We do have a large amount of data. 

The challenge is we want to design a model to identify locations of sensors. In other words, let person wear a set of 8 sensors at those 8 locations, then the model will determine which sensor is at which location. I know there must be some relationship between sensors, so classifying 8 sensors’ locations at the same makes more sense than classifying one sensor by one sensor. 

I have troubles to determine which types of model I should look for. Or someone already has done these kind of work? I googled and search many papers, but no luck.

For the input data: let’s say we have n persons, each person have m_1, m_2, ... , m_n minutes of recordings. I have sliced each recording into 10 minutes chunks, and labeled sensor’s location in {1, 2, ... , 8}.

16,[R] Mitigating mode averaging in flow generative models,piaget-marr,1599282271,"Hi,  


I am training a flow generative model (around 100 dimensional input and base distribution) on continuous dataset that has two modes. I notice that my converged model suffer from the mode averaging phenomenon. The generated samples from the flow model spread more or less uniformly in a region between the two modes (think of them in Euclidean space). These ""between-the modes"" samples also have high log llikelihood, which can be computed exactly in a flow. My suspicion is that it is very difficult to train a flow model with high-dimensional Gaussian base distribution. The distribution peak is very sharp and has exponentially smaller density, thus making the optimization using NLL difficult.  I am looking for suggestions in terms of debugging or nice/common tricks to avoid mode averaging in a flow model. I also wonder if other generative models are less prone for this kind of problems. For example, a VAE, which does not require diffeomorphism between the data and the base distributions.

For example, driving along the road past a packed parking lot, the parking lot may be in a no-label zone since it would be difficult to label and, not being on the roadway, is irrelevant to the current logic of the vehicle. I need to account for this in training, not punishing my network for ""false positives"" in the no label zones which are actually true positives. The most straightforward approach for me would be zeroing out the contribution of this data to the loss function. But this would presumably cause any scenes with no-label zones to have comparatively lower loss, which could lead to an undesirable overfitting to no-label scenes. Should I then perform a normalization that increases the loss proportionally to the amount of removed data, i.e. a scene with 1/4 of the input data missing would have its loss scaled by 4/3?

For the past couple of years I have been throughly studying from Christopher Bishop’s book on Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML). It has been a pain in the head, but I believe that the time invested was totally worth it.

One of the main difficulties that I had whilst studying PRML were the algorithmic implementation of the models. Some times, the equations were easier to derive that to implement, in other times, the book made references to a document by ""Bishop and Nabney"" to address some of the numerical errors that one could face when implementing the models. However, the reference is nonexistent and I had to experience the drawbacks myself. 

The aim of the project is to show in a self-contained notebook the implementation for the majority of the algorithms and discuss in some detail the numerical problems that could arise when implementing the code.

## How to use the notes

After you’ve finished a section of a chapter in which and algorithm or idea is discussed, head to the notes and read through the code. The notes will give you the practical implementation of the idea.

## What you get

More than 60 self-contained jupyter notebooks of Machine Learning.

I am a Machine Learning Student. I am currently doing my Masters and  I am going to graduate by end of this year. I am planning to enroll for a PhD program after this. Now the problem is I have very little to no experience in research and most of the good colleges require some kind of research experience.

44,[D]I made GAN that undress women wearing any dress. What would you do next to lift performance ?,AllYouNeedIsDeep,1599242128,"**Intro**
Hello ML enthusiasts.
I am engaged in the project undressing/nudifier GAN.

project site
https://deepsukebe.io/

My goal is to generate photo realistic image &amp; accurately estimate the state of undressed women.

**Model Building**
I did so far:
- collect millions of images
- building baseline model from image inpainting literature
- lots grid search for architecture &amp; training parameters

The experiments I tried is too many to write.
But, every time the promising research emerge, I incorporated the essence to my model.
e.g. noise injection from Style GAN.

Until some point, modification to the model gave me good performance improvement.
But these day, computational cost get grow but performance return fewer.

**Problem**
The overall problem is:
- high computational cost (training time &amp; memory constraint)
- no robust metrics (FID has blind spot on fine-grained details)
So, difficult to scale.

Say, Big GAN tell us that simple model scaling like using largest batch size endow huge boosts.
But, I am only able to run model with minibatch size of 6 or so even if I use V100 GPU.
And, it is difficult to train the model with large cluster of V100 for personal project.

How do you tackle ?",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/imktlg/di_made_gan_that_undress_women_wearing_any_dress/

We are trialing a new publication and peer review model, based on pre-registering experiments. We would like to invite authors to publish and present their work at our Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2020 Workshop.

* Proposals deadline: October 7th 2020
* Experiments deadline: April 2021

More information here: [https://preregister.science](http://preregister.science/)  
**What is pre-registration?**  
Benchmarks on popular datasets have played a key role in the considerable measurable progress that machine learning has made in the last few years. But reviewers can be tempted to prioritize incremental improvements in benchmarks to the detriment of other scientific criteria, destroying many good ideas in their infancy. Authors can also feel obligated to make orthogonal improvements in order to “beat the state-of-the-art”, making the main contribution hard to assess.

Pre-registration changes the incentives by reviewing and accepting a paper *before* any experiments are conducted. The emphasis of peer-review will be on whether the experiment plan can adequately prove or disprove one (or more) hypotheses. Some results will be negative, and this is welcomed. This way, good ideas that do not work will get published, instead of filed away and wastefully replicated many times by different groups. Finally, the clear separation between hypothesizing and confirmation (absent in the current review model) will raise the statistical significance of the results.

The final papers (proposals + experimental results) will be published at the workshop and (optionally) with the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (**PMLR**).",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/imew49/news_neurips2020_the_preregistration_experiment/

This model can tell its own accuracy. As I didn't have real data to train the model, I randomly generated samples of 12000 patient writing another program and for that training set the model has an accuracy of 91.56%. It will be interesting to test it with real life data. 

Though I know it won't be that much useful now to detect Covid-19 as there are many cases where patient has no symptoms but tested positive for Coronavirus. But adding features like thermal imaging and X-ray will give much more reliable result. And as the model itself tells its accuracy for a particular result and a particular training set, It won't be difficult to understand whether the model is useful or not. 

I'm planning to improve this and make a program for numerical research of Medical science and the symptoms of various diseases , which will give a visual representation of the features( for example :  which symptom is most unique for 'X' disease, What percentage of people with 'Y' symptom tested positive for 'X' disease or  What percentage of people with 'X' diseases has 'Y' symptom)

![video](jvrhl3m5s2l51)

 I have been working on solving the problem of Bots (or automation in general) as seen on multiple social media sites including Instagram and Youtube where the comments are constantly spammed with Promotional Bots or Sexually Explicit Bots.

After a lot of reading through Instagram's privacy policy, I finally found a proper way in which I could scrape the graphql and curate a dataset (which I later found was already implemented in a library called igramscraper, all credits to realsirjoe on Github)

A few experiments down the line I was able to structure a pipeline which involved removing hashtags, emotes(I am still experimenting with these) and most commonly found nuisance of having multiple letters (example- HhoOottt). The training process that followed was made much easier after I spent almost 5 days to properly structure the data. For all of you who are looking for metrics, I will state some of my results and experiments

1. Support Vector Classifier- F1: 0.9911, Precision: 0.9912, Recall: 0.9911 (Currently Deployed)
2. Passive Aggressive Classifier: F1: 0.9857, Precision: 0.9861, Recall: 0.985 (Will probably switch to this later just because of it's online nature)
3. Random Forest: F1: 0.9419, Precision: 0.9437, Recall: 0.9416
4. XGBoost: F1: 0.9357, Precision: 0.9321, Recall: 0.9392
5. Ensembled LSTM Models: F1: 0.9732, Precision: 0.9722, Recall: 0.9740
6. 2-Headed Custom Transformer: F1:0.9938, Precision: 0.9939 , Recall: 0.9938 (Performed well on test set but a bit dicey for real life predictions. Needs more data)

The video demonstrates how the API calls to the model exactly work. The entire scraping and inference process is highly optimized and has been benchmarked at under 5 seconds for processing 500 comments. The future training and data labelling will be done using Active Learning, thereby making it much easier to correct the mistakes made by the model and keep the system up to date)

I recently reached out to Laurence Moroney sir and he told me it was an insightful idea as even he is struggling with spam on his youtube live sessions. The site has a scheduled selenium script in the backend for reporting all bots once a day but I am still finding a better way to implement this without Instagram raising issues. I hope to reach some developer at Instagram soon regarding this.

96,[R] I made a website for predicting whether your NeurIPS paper will be accepted based off the reviews,programmerChilli,1599180937,"http://horace.io/willmypaperbeaccepted/

I've seen a lot of comments over the last couple days asking about NeurIPS chances. 

I trained a set model (total 250 parameters) on ICLR 2019 reviews (which also use a 1-10 rating scale, and has a very similar acceptance threshold). Both conferences reject pretty much all papers with &lt;5 average, and accept all papers with &gt;7 average. An average 6 rating also corresponds to a 50% chance of acceptance at both conferences.

Some observations:

1. Confidence scores barely matter. It rarely changes the acceptance probabilities by a significant amount. I was curious why most of the data visualization by conferences, like [NeurIPS](https://medium.com/@NeurIPSConf/what-we-learned-from-neurips-2019-data-111ab996462c) completely ignored confidence scores in favor of simply the mean rating. However, any sort of confidence weighted mean ended up being less predictive than the raw mean.

2. Interestingly, confidence scores of 5 seem to be weighted less heavily than confidence scores of 4. For example, (7,7,5) with confidences (4,4,4) results in 75.6% chance of acceptance. However, if you change the confidences of the 7 reviews to 5, the chance of acceptance falls to 70%. I suspect that there are a lot of low quality reviews with rating 5 that end up being discounted by the ACs.

27,[Discussion] Using uncertainty in raw labels in loss function of model,TheDuke57,1599157765,"We have generated a dataset where there are multiple numeric scores (prevalence of phenomena on range 0-1) for each image. The dataset is about 100k images,  where each image has been labeled at least twice by separate users. In my data exploration I found that some users consistently rate images 20-30% higher than all other users. We also did a little bit of user consistency testing by mixing in the same set of image into the rest of their work (same images 35 times by a domain expert over course of 3 months). We found that user ratings are always within +/- 15% of their average score (ie: if the ground truth is 0.3, the resulting labels are always between 0.15-0.45). Because I have some of these underlying stats about how the labels change person to person and over time, is there a way to incorporate this knowledge into my model or loss function?

One idea I had was to set the target for each image by sampling from N(score\_mean, score\_std) and re-sampling every time the image is used. My gut feeling is that this will help the model generalize as the labels are not fixed, but are always within what a domain expert has labeled the image.

Another idea I had was to have a per sample weight to the loss for each image where the weight is a function of the standard deviation of the scores (assigning more weight to score where all the labels tend to agree with each other).

I'm working on my master thesis right now, wherein I propose a new model. Naturally, finetuning and hyperparameter selection is a part of development. Because of the number of trials done, there's bound to be noise involved, which means the larger parameter space one explores, the more likely it is to choose a ""good"" model just because of a fluke.

This led me to question about the process of hyperparameter selection. Shouldn't there be a more rigorous approach to it than just selecting the hyperparameters that give the best validation measure? I think it would be useful when the author can say that some hyperparameters are more important than others, so resources would be spent focusing on those, while keeping others to a small scope, or even not adjusting at all.

An alternate approach is to mix the large dataset with a small sprinkling of dataset B, and have the model learn nuances of dataset B using the small sub sample.

This is appropriate for clinical use cases given that data is expensive and hard to come by.

50,Biological Based AI assistant [D],jpatton19,1599145248,"From my experience and research, most of of ai, even neural networks, when it boils down to it, is just a bunch of math and high level statistics and probability.

My question and prompt for discussion is that if we eventually want to make an ai that can “replicate” the human brain and the way humans learn, wouldn’t it be better to try from a mostly biological approach, rather than using math to try and replicate it.

Like instead of hard coding neurons in the neural net, would it not be better to code a neuron very similar to what we know about our own physical neurons, and feed them data and let it learn for itself and establish relationships by having input.

I know we probably don’t know nearly enough about how the brain works and how our neurons actually function in terms of understanding, but it is an interesting point of view to look at. Because in the end, our brains don’t work on equations and statistics, our brains work logically by using our neurons to establish relationships and “learn”. So it seems counter intuitive to call it artificial intelligence when in reality all it is is high level statistics and calculus",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/ilv1ei/biological_based_ai_assistant_d/

I’m a beginner here who is trying to build a model for my personal project (albeit using data I got from my firm). 
The data is a call center dataset , and Im trying to predict the number of successful sales made per employee in the week based on several predictors (time at desk, log in time, calls made etc)

I’ve so far trained a GBM and I’ve gotten some predictions (for context, the range is from 0 to 10 sales made).

Here are my questions:

1. Now that I have my predictions, how do I separate the impact of each predictor like I would with Beta coefficients from a GLM? 
I’m trying to solve the question : what predictors contributes (quantitatively) to a caller’s sales volume? So with Beta coefficients I can say, for caller A, number of time spent at desk is the biggest driver to his/her sales volume.
But since GBMs doesn’t have Beta coefficients, is there an alternative? Is SHAP for this purpose? Or do I need to just stick with a GLM?

2. What are the best ways to diagnose/validate my model? 
Given that this is a non binary classification, it seems that I can’t use ROC/gains curve/GINI to diagnose? 
I remember seeing somewhere that this still works with continuous outcomes, but I can no longer find that article! It says something like ROC can be used if I rank the outcomes by deciles or something like that....

18,[D] DL Computing resources for solo research,atyshka,1599086769,"I’m beginning to plan my undergrad thesis project and I’d like to be related to AV perception as that’s the field I’d like to work in. I’ve read dozens of papers and had a few years of internship experience so conceptually I feel fit to create a novel architecture. But in terms of resources (computing) I’m lacking. One really cool paper I wanted to try implementing said they trained with batch size of 128, for 300k iterations, using 32 gpus. Let’s assume it takes 1 second to process one batch. That still comes out to 3.4 days. Attempting to run that on a single GPU (like in colab) would take over 3 months.

Now I understand that while the model may need that much data to achieve state of the art performance, accounting for learning decay the model probably would be decent with 1/10 of those iterations. But even that puts me at roughly 10 days.

Is it an impossible task to attempt a big data problem like AV perception without a $100000 GPU cluster at your disposal? I can get some funding from my school, best case scenario $2000 to go towards either hardware or renting cloud instances. Throwing in $500 of my own money could get me a decent RTX 3090 rig.

26,[Discussion] Yolo overfit to my validation set and I don't know why,TinProgrammer,1599074721," 

I am using the AlexeyAB branch of darknet.

I work at a small company and in order to get around the issue of not having a lot of data I've been experimenting with generating large synthetic datasets. In particular, I am trying to get it to recognize rgb images of propane tanks. In order to do this I used GIMP to close-crop ten random images of propane tanks I found on google images and I have a program that performs a bunch of random transformations (color, lighting, size, stretch, blur, salt-pepper, crop) and then sticks it on top of a random background (scrapped from google images ""desktop backgrounds""). As my training set I used 10000 of these synthetic images. For my validation set I used 100 hand-labeled images of a propane tank that I have in the office (it's a brand and color that doesn't match any of the 10 tanks I pulled from google).

To clarify: the training set consisted of only synthetic data and the validation set only had the hand-labeled images. This was just a first-pass test and, especially given that I only had 10 images as a base and all were taken from a side-on angle, I expected it to do fairly poor in training. I was pleasantly surprised to see the loss during training drop like a rock. However, I was concerned when I walked in the next day and saw that the loss had fallen to nearly zero. I pulled out the weights and ran it on the validation set. It had nearly perfectly confident detection on all of the images, which immediately raised a ton of red flags. I took another video of the same propane tank in the office and used the network on that... and it performed terribly.

This is hugely concerning. I may have some fundamental misunderstanding of how Yolo uses the validation set, but as far as I know the general understanding of the validation set in machine learning is so that the researcher can get a general idea for how well the network is performing by calculating the validation loss. The network should NEVER let its training be directly influenced by the validation set. I was always a little curious about why I never saw the characteristic ""elbow"" in the loss chart when I use Yolo, but I've never tried it on such a skewed set of data before so I never questioned it.

To try and confirm that Yolo is indeed making use of the validation set, I'm going to try making a proof of concept example, possibly by having it train on a training set that's from a different dataset than the validation set and seeing if it still somehow manages to fit onto the validation set. If I find time to get around to this in the next few weeks I'll update this post with the results and what I did to get them, but I just wanted to get this information out as soon as possible given its severity.

To be clear, Yolo is a great network and I've been very happy with the results in other projects that I've used it on. I feel like I'm on crazy pills; I've used Yolo so many times and it's so widely used in general that this doesn't seem possible, but I've checked and double checked my splits and files and I can't come to any other conclusion. If it is somehow allowing the data in the validation set to leak back into training then that's a serious issue. If anyone can clear up what is happening here, maybe my understanding of validation sets is flawed, then I would love to hear it. As it stands though, for a network that is so widely used and serves as a great entry point for machine learning, this kind of thing can't sit unaddressed.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/ildlc7/discussion_yolo_overfit_to_my_validation_set_and/

30,[P] Vulkan as an alternative to CUDA in scientific simulation software - computational magnetism,xdtolm,1599072696,"This is a continuation post to the [VkFFT announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ia6gv1/p_new_vulkan_fft_library_vkfft_opensource/). Here I present an example of scientific application, that outperforms its CUDA counterpart, has no proprietary code behind it and is crossplatform - [Vulkan Spirit](https://github.com/DTolm/spirit). This is a fully GPU version of the computational magnetism package Spirit, developed at FZ Jülich. I hope this post can motivate other scientists (including machine learning researchers) to explore the world of Vulkan for scientific GPU computing, as right now it is heavily dominated by CUDA. 

From mathematical point of view, simulation of a magnetic system in micromagnetics can be described as a system of differential equations ([LLG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landau%E2%80%93Lifshitz%E2%80%93Gilbert_equation)) on a finite-difference mesh. Each cell's position is influenced by positions of its neighbors, material parameters, external effects and many other things. Successful iterative integration of the LLG system can yield time dynamics, resembling experimentally observed evolutuon of magnetics.

From the programming point of view, simulation software is simpler than the one that has to communicate with the user during runtime. There are no calculations performed on the CPU during the execution, so it is only used to create a command buffer before launch, which is not modified afterwards. Combining multiple iterations in a single command buffer significantly reduces initialization overhead and is one of the main benefits of using Vulkan due to its low-level nature.

The Vulkan Spirit includes many algorithms written in SPIR-V shaders, such as LBFGS, VP and CG energy minimizers, RK4 and Depondt integrators of differential equations. The VkFFT library was primarily developed to compute the Dipole-Dipole interaction part of the gradient, which is one of the most time consuming parts of the iteration. It was possible to optimize every single part of the command buffer to reduce memory transfers to the minimum due to the explicit memory handling of Vulkan. This allowed to get up to 3x performance increase in comparison to CUDA based micromagnetics code mumax3. More information can be found on the github repository: [https://github.com/DTolm/spirit](https://github.com/DTolm/spirit)

Thanks for the read!

As a side note, the [VkFFT](https://github.com/DTolm/VkFFT) has been improved in the past month - it supports WHDCN layout, 8k sequences and Intel iGPUs, so it can be already used for CNNs with big kernels (I plan on doing an example application on this soon). There is also a benchmark uploaded that can be used to compare the performance to the cuFFT.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/ilcw2f/p_vulkan_as_an_alternative_to_cuda_in_scientific/

65,[P] My first blog post – on how to plot decision boundaries,hedgehogist,1599044328,"Hey guys, I have written my first blog post on how to plot decision boundaries for classification models. Plotting decision boundaries can help immensely in the model selection and hyperparameter tuning process, as it can help detect overfitting or underfitting. [Here](https://vivianrjkmr.github.io/2020/09/01/decision-boundary-visualization) is the link.

**The motivation for my post**

I noticed that many online explanations and tutorials explaining overfitting rely on 2D datasets (i.e. datasets with only two input features). Such boundaries can be easily plotted on a 2D plane, but what if your data contains six input features? One can use dimensionality reduction to plot the actual points, but what about the decision boundaries themselves? This is what my post explores.

It would be an amazing help if you could spare some time to take a look, and maybe give me some feedback. If you liked it, feel free to ""like"" my post.

Neural Cellular Automata are models for how living creatures can use local message passing to reach global consensus without a central authority. This paper teaches pixels of an image to communicate with each other and figure out as a group which digit they represent. On the way, the authors have to deal with pesky side-effects that come from applying the Cross-Entropy Loss in combination with a Softmax layer, but ultimately achieve a self-sustaining, stable and continuous algorithm that models living systems.

**Abstract**

In 2020, we are celebrating the 10-year anniversary of our [publication](http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0358) in Neural Computation (2010) on deep multilayer perceptrons trained by plain gradient descent on GPU. Surprisingly, our simple but unusually deep supervised artificial neural network (NN) outperformed all previous methods on the (back then famous) machine learning benchmark MNIST. That is, by 2010, when compute was 100 times more expensive than today, both our feedforward NNs and our earlier recurrent NNs (e.g., [CTC-LSTM for connected handwriting recognition](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204)) were able to beat all competing algorithms on important problems of that time. In [the 2010s](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html), this deep learning revolution quickly spread from Europe to America and Asia.

81,[D] How does everybody statistically compare different NN training methods over multiple test datasets with different numbers of test samples?,SunnyJapan,1599024356,"Say you have a method A and method B. For example, method A could be training a neural network with dropout, and method B is training the same neural net without dropout.

You train a model with each of those methods, say, three times, so now you have 6 trained models.
And you have 10 different test datasets, each with different number of samples, over which you care about the accuracy.

Imagine that after training the models and testing them on all the test sets, you notice that there is a big difference on one of the test sets. How do you know whether that difference is statistically significant or not, i.e. what would be the probability to obtain such (or higher) difference on one of the datasets by chance?

There are multiple sources of uncertainty here: uncertainty due to sampling the data, uncertainty due to sampling the models, and also the bias of multiple hypothesis testing. How do you combine them to come up with a single probability value?

Uncertainty due to sampling the data: refers to the variability in accuracies for the bootstrap sample of the given dataset, and can be decreased by increasing the number of samples.

Uncertainty due to sampling the models: refers to the variability in test accuracies for different models that you would obtain from training the models in the same way multiple times (due to initial weight initialization, etc.).

87,[D] Is there a way to determine whether or not a transformation on a word embedding vector matrix is an isometry?,Seankala,1599019197,"Hi. I'm not sure if ""isometry"" is even the right word to use here, but here goes.

I'm reading some papers on debiasing word embeddings and a recurring topic/problem in these papers is the issue of ""bias by neighbors."" This basically refers to the phenomenon that debiasing techniques may be able to reduce the bias component of word embeddings (e.g., by making gender-neutral words such as ""computer programmer"" equidistant from ""male"" and ""female"" etc.) but how bias is still reflected in the neighborhood of the word embeddings. For example, the words ""nurse"" and ""receptionist"" still being close together.

My intuition is that since debiasing techniques don't seem to change the inherent structure of the embeddings, there must be some inherent structure that isn't being addressed.

Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks.

4,[P][D] Genetic Algorithm (GA) vs. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD),brainxyz,1599003051,"For functions that have narrow grooves toward the global minima a simple GA implementation can be as efficient as a naive SGD method. Geoffrey Hinton, in one of his videos (Lecture 3.4) mentioned that GA randomly perturbs one weight at a time making it very inefficient compared to backpropagation. Here we present a simple GA implementation which simultaneously mutates all the weights and can learn reasonably efficiently. To implement such network all you need is to follow these simple steps:    
 

1. Implement a feed forward Neural Network (just like you do for an SGD based Neural Network).
2. In the weight update step, mutate all the weights by adding a small random value to each weight.
3. Do  feed-forward propagation twice, one with the mutated weights (child  weights) and another with the original weights (parent weights).
4. Compare the performance of the parent weights to the child weights and keep the better ones for the next generation cycle.
5. Repeat steps from 2 to 4 until you reach convergence.

While researching this topic, we found that most papers in spoken language recognition used private or expensive datasets, limiting reproducibility. We also found that many papers made performance claims without comparing to other recent research. We attempted to address these problems in this capstone project. Using public sources such as Mozilla's Common Voice, we constructed an eight-language dataset and compared three neural network architectures published in the last few years.

(other research assistant-ship fell through),csmath773,1598993474,"4 months ago I started a volunteer undergraduate research assistant-ship at school x, I transferred to school y this Fall. I simply wanted to gain experience and at that time I did not care about publishing. The lab was very hands off, especially with volunteers.

Since then, I decided I want to get my PhD in CS, so now I am trying to get involved in research. At the research job, I was asked to implement a framework to solve a motion detection problem. To do so, I was provided with a surveillance video from a street camera. I was not able to implement it properly, but last month I came across a conference paper presentation which gave me a *potentially* great idea on how to solve this problem. I did tons of research and was excited to talk to my supervisor about this today. To my surprise, he told me I cannot be associated with the lab because I am now at a different school and its a C.O.I (conflict of interest) without signing legal documents. I am fine with signing some papers, but they *don't have funding*, so I wouldn't be recognized as a real member of the lab and my name could not go on papers. They suggested that I try to find a professor at my new school to work on the problem with.

I have 0 problem doing this research myself (I planned to do the bulk of it). The problem is the data. I was given a 30 minute video of an intersection. I was going to ask the professor if I could at least use his video for my own research. However, I never even had my name on a paper as a co or last author, so I'm not sure how likely it is that I'll be able to publish solo with no prior experience.

33,[R] Visual Explanation for Deep Metric Learning,Extension-Sun1816,1598982269,"This work explores the visual explanation for deep metric learning and its applications. As an important problem for learning representation, metric learning has attracted much attention recently, while the interpretation of the metric learning model is not as well-studied as classification. To this end, we propose an intuitive idea to show where contributes the most to the overall similarity of two input images by decomposing the final activation. Instead of only providing the overall activation map of each image, we propose to generate point-to-point activation intensity between two images so that the relationship between different regions is uncovered. We show that the proposed framework can be directly applied to a wide range of metric learning applications and provides valuable information for model understanding. Both theoretical and empirical analyses are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed overall activation map over existing methods. 

Furthermore, our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed point-specific activation map on two applications, i.e. cross-view pattern discovery and interactive retrieval.

**(2) For papers with specific applications (e.g., healthcare or transportation), typically the application is NOT the primary keyword. Usually, a AAAI main track paper will make methodological advances leading to an impact to an application. Choose a primary keyword based on the methodology. There is one exception to this rule: if the impact to the application area is much more impressive than the methodological innovation, your paper may have the best chance with the application area being the primary keyword. That said, you should carefully consider whether such a paper is more appropriate to submit to the track on AI for Social Impact or to IAAI; note that each of these evaluates papers according to different criteria than the AAAI main track.**

I looked at other options, and they don't seem to quite hit the spot, e.g. all 'adversarial'-stuff is not relevant. Again, all 'applications'-areas should be secondary. So what should I choose then?

I think I did everything completely right and I'm not posting for help with this specifically... What I wanted to discuss was this:

With a Sigmoid output layer, my neural network works on the Iris dataset with correct parameters.  With incorrect parameters, it will either give the ~same output for each class or it will pick a class and classify every output as the same class.

Now with Softmax, I've been able to replicate these latter two cases , but I cannot parameterize the network in a way that it classifies correctly.  In trying to plot MSE I always get diverging errors (for high learning rate) or flat error at all training steps for learning rates that predict equal outputs for all classes.

Does anyone else have this problem?  From what I can tell, many of the best researchers swear by Softmax.  When the labels are all ""sum one"" it should not be this hard to get it working, right?  And, more generally, how do you all parameterize your networks (especially learning rate and number of layers / layer sizes)?  I'm just looping through learning rates and plotting the MSE over all training steps, but I feel that there has to be a better way.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/ikiikp/discussion_difficulty_in_implementing_softmax/

It seems ""somehow"" to work. But there is one big issue: when i add the regularization term (for the first the KL divergence, for the 2nd the energy term computed from wasserstein distances) to the loss the score of Link reconstruction, computed in AUC is lower than before, so leading to worse results while it should be the opposite.

69,[P] I'm launching Derk's Gym today: A Gpu accelerated MOBA RL Environment,FredrikNoren,1598950818,"Hi /r/MachineLearning!

I'm launching something I call ""Derk's Gym"" today: https://gym.derkgame.com/

It's a MOBA Reinforcement learning environment that runs entirely on the GPU and supports benchmarking against other players online.

Some details:

- It's based on my game Dr. Derk's Mutant Battlegrounds, a ""neural network MOBA"", which I posted about a few weeks ago [1]. (When I posted about it a bunch of people asked for an API, so I figured why not add it :) 
- It's OpenAI Gym compatible (or at least as close as I could make it in a multi-agent environment)
- The game runs entirely on the GPU, so you can easily run hundreds of ""arenas"" simultaneously (I usually run 128)
- There are 15 different items, and the agents have ~60 senses and 5 actions. There are ~22 rewards you can configure, and I'm adding more stuff all the time.
- With a simple config switch you can benchmark your agent by playing against other peoples agents online (ELO based ranking). I'm also providing some ready made agents that are always online that you can measure up against.
- It's free to use if you are just training for personal use, otherwise I'm charging money for it to make it long term sustainable to operate for me (more details on the website).
- Docs are here: http://docs.gym.derkgame.com/

I'd love to hear what people here think!

I am trying to implement Neural Head Reenactment with Latent Pose Descriptors (Burkov et al 2020), but my model doesn't seem to be interested in animating the facial expressions! Only the broader motions are captured...

Some specific questions/comments on my part:

* One notable difference between the paper and my implementation is the dataset - they centered the faces whereas I allow some small motions. Do you think this alone is sufficient to explain the phenomenon above?
* In my trials, I noted the big variability of performance on the optimizer parameters. The paper says that it inherits a lot of implementation details from \[1\], but noted that they now do a combined Discriminator/Generator backward step. This is as opposed to \[1\], in which there are 2 different optimizers for the D and the G with 2 different learning rates (2e-4 and 5e-5 respectively), and with the D optimizer taking 2 steps for every step of the G optimizer. My way of reconciling this (given the lack of details) is to train at 5e-5, but with a 8x coefficient on the D loss (since 2 x 2e-4 / 5e-5 = 8) to roughly give D the same amount of supervisory signal.
* Would really appreciate if you could verify my projection discriminator loss (implemented via all the W\_i around)

**Why should I care**?

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to be effective models for different predictive tasks on graph-structured data. Recent work on their expressive power has focused on isomorphism tasks and countable feature spaces. In this work, the authors focus on a theoretically motivated aggregation function that includes continuous feature spaces. The authors propose Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation (PNA), a novel architecture combining multiple aggregators with degree-scalers (which generalize the sum aggregator). They compare the capacity of different models to capture and exploit the graph structure via a novel benchmark containing multiple tasks taken from classical graph theory, alongside existing benchmarks from real-world domains, all of which demonstrate the strength of their model. This work sheds some light on new aggregation methods which are essential in the search for powerful and robust models.

**What will be discussed**?

* Limitations of single aggregator functions for various neighbourhood sizes and feature distributions
* The best type of aggregator (hint: the answer is none.)
* Optimally expressive GNNs
* Training multi-task GNNs

15,[P] Type-driven Neural Programming by Example,tycho0111,1598899306,"Hi! I just submitted my AI thesis [to arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12613), and figured maybe I'd post about it to get feedback here.
It's about neural methods in program synthesis (specifically programming by example), where I wanted to try adding programming types as features to improve learning.
(Details at the link above, so I'll try not to repeat too much from there.)

While this idea seemed to help in my experiment, it requires an approach of incrementally synthesizing one AST node at a time. This is to be contrasted with e.g.:
- the recent [neural-guided search](https://alexpolozov.com/blog/program-synthesis-2018/#neural-guided-search), which may simply run compiler checks to filter bad types directly i.e. shouldn't need types as features
- token-based synthesis i.e. seq2seq methods including juggernaut [GPT-3](https://twitter.com/soumithchintala/status/1263221177650159620), which does not facilitate using types for intermediate synthesis steps (as these may not yet constitute valid programs)

As a result, having this broader perspective now, I don't wanna make large claims about the impact of my work.
That said, while seq2seq methods are nice for e.g. facilitating parallel computation as well as being more general (able to use natural language instead of examples), I think my direction has some merits as well. Notably, I think it better facilitates the more scalable RL-based weakly-supervised training method, i.e. one might use compiler feedback + type info to teach it to abandon non-compiling programs long before the full program has been synthesized.
(My present implementation unfortunately settled for the simpler strongly-supervised approach.)

An alternative there would be to use both a compiler and a synthesizer at prediction time, so the synthesizer wouldn't need to learn type stuff as it could simply delegate that to the compiler (as I mentioned for neural-guided search above).
Caveat: either the compiler or the synthesizer may add to synthesis time reasoning about types.
I did in fact try the symbiotic approach as a side experiment, which for me turned out faster than my neural approach (I didn't know how to parallelize my implementation over task functions), but I failed to confirm how well this might do due to flaws in the interpreter I used for type-checks.

As a fun aside, as I needed to delegate my type logic to an existing language, I implemented this project using [HaskTorch](https://github.com/hasktorch/hasktorch), a PyTorch wrapper in the Haskell language offering static typing, where my questions were met by a helpful community that included PyTorch creator Adam Paszke.
Implementation using HaskTorch offered some nice stuff like statically verifying your tensor dimensions add up, tho I definitely had a learning experience there as well.
(One of the rough edges was combining static checks with delaying hyperparam values to run-time, which with some help I worked out tho at some added verbosity still.)

With so many overhyped tutorials on the topic, I thought it would be helpful to organize some resources in a trusted place. It also has a few project ideas because many topics are best learnt by doing. The project is [open source](https://github.com/getting-started-ml/getting-started-ml.github.io/) on GitHub.

The goal is to make [gettingstarted.ml](https://gettingstarted.ml?s=r) the go-to place for everyone who is seriously looking to get into ML, or wanting to learn more about a particular topic. I know many redditors in this sub are probably well beyond this point, but that also means you are probably most qualified to help beginners! So if you enjoyed a good paper or online course please consider taking a minute to add it to the list :) Project recommendations are welcome as well.

29,[R] Hyperparameter Tuning for Transformers,dahdarknite,1598888679,"Hi all!

Recently there’s been some discussion about how to efficiently tune hyperparameters for large transformer models where even running one iteration is pretty expensive. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ibrlvt/d\_how\_do\_ml\_researchers\_make\_progress\_when/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ibrlvt/d_how_do_ml_researchers_make_progress_when/)). It seems like companies that can afford it use more sophisticated approaches but the vast majority of people end up just doing a naive grid search over a few different hyperparameters.

I tried out a couple hyperparameter algorithms and found that [Population Based Training](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/population-based-training-neural-networks) could sizably increase model accuracy without increasing the tuning budget (for certain tasks).

I wrote up my experiences and a couple tips in this [blog post](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/hyperparameter-optimization-for-transformers-a-guide-c4e32c6c989b) leveraging [Hugging Face transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) and [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune.html).

31,[P] Spock v1.1.0 - Managing complex parameter configurations in Python,RicketyCricket,1598886866,"[https://github.com/fidelity/spock](https://github.com/fidelity/spock)

## About

`spock` is a framework that helps manage complex parameter configurations during research and development of Python applications. `spock` let's you focus on the code you need to write instead of re-implementing boilerplate code like creating ArgParsers, reading configuration files, implementing traceability etc.

In short, `spock` configurations (backed by [attrs](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs)) are defined by simple and familiar class-based structures (similar to a schema). This allows `spock` to support inheritance, read from multiple markdown formats, and allow hierarchical configuration by composition.

## Key Features

* Simple Declaration: Type checked parameters are defined within a `@spock` decorated class. Supports required/optional and automatic defaults.
* Easily Managed Parameter Groups: Each class automatically generates its own object within a single namespace.
* Parameter Inheritance: Classes support inheritance allowing for complex configurations derived from a common base set (or sets) of parameters.
* Multiple Configuration File Types: Configurations are specified from YAML, TOML, or JSON files.
* Hierarchical Configuration: Composed from multiple configuration files via simple include statements.
* Command-Line Overrides: Quickly experiment by overriding a value with automatically generated command line arguments
* Immutable: All classes are *frozen* preventing any misuse or accidental overwrites.
* Tractability and Reproducibility: Save currently running parameter configuration with a single chained command.

## Documentation

[https://fidelity.github.io/spock/](https://fidelity.github.io/spock/)

## Why?

1. During research, development, and production of machine learning models (especially deep learning models) the total number of configuration parameters within a codebase can quickly spiral out of control: data-related parameters, model hyper-parameters, logging parameters, i/o parameters, etc. After writing parser.add\_argument() for the 1000th time we figured there had to be a better way to manage the complex configurations needed for modern ML models.
2. Looking across a fast-moving enterprise scale AI organization, we noticed a pretty fractured set of configuration management practices across the organization (and even within groups).

## What about X, Y, Z?

There are other great open source configuration libraries available for Python. We think that `spock` fits within this space by providing a simple and lightweight configuration management library in comparison to other libraries. The main two that fill a similar role as `spock` are:

[gin-config](https://github.com/google/gin-config)

&gt;Provides a lightweight configuration framework for Python, based on dependency injection

`gin-config` does a lot of things and does them pretty well. However, we found that `gin-config`'s dependency injection and heavy use of decorators just didn't fit what we wanted. Dynamic injection provides a less verbose configuration solution, but can lack reproducibility depending on where and how parameters are defined. In addition, the pretty large 'kitchen sink' of different ways to manage configurations wasn't simple nor lightweight enough of a solution.

[Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra)

&gt;A framework for elegantly configuring complex applications

At the time we started building `spock` Hydra wasn't available. Hydra is similar to `spock` but is more restrictive in its functionality and syntax. Similar to `gin-config` parameters are dynamically injected via a decorator which limits type checking, reproducibility, and traceability. In addition, `Hydra` doesn't (or didn't at the time of writing) support inheritance which was a big motivator for creating a new solution.

## TL;DR

80,[D] GPU for Deep Learning: GTX 1080 Ti vs. RTX 2070s,ballsdeep-learning,1598828202,"Hello everyone!

Sorry for yet another ""which GPU to buy"" -post, but I have a hard time deciding and would like to hear your opinion. I am building a PC that will be used for deep learning. My GPU budget is 450€. In this price range the choice narrows down to either a second hand GTX 1080 Ti or a new RTX 2070 Super which I can buy for the same price (RTX 2070S is slightly cheaper).

I am fairly new to deep learning and want to explore a range of different kinds of models. Therefore my focus is on a well-rounded GPU rather than optimizing for a specific type of networks. 

Regarding the performance, both cards seem to be very close. While the GTX has more CUDA cores and 11GB memory, the RTX with 8GB has Tensor Cores which allow for mixing/ changing float precision to 16 bit and thus increasing the memory, as suggested by [this often cited article by Tim Dettmers](https://timdettmers.com/2019/04/03/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/). A disadvantage of the GTX is that it has a higher power consumption and therefore would be more expensive in the long run.

I am torn between the two options. 

What would you suggest?

Abstract: Adversarial examples are malicious inputs crafted to induce misclassification. Commonly studied sensitivity-based adversarial examples introduce semantically-small changes to an input that result in a different model prediction. This paper studies a complementary failure mode, invariance-based adversarial examples, that introduce minimal semantic changes that modify an input's true label yet preserve the model's prediction. We demonstrate fundamental tradeoffs between these two types of adversarial examples. We show that defenses against sensitivity-based attacks actively harm a model's accuracy on invariance-based attacks, and that new approaches are needed to resist both attack types. In particular, we break state-of-the-art adversarially-trained and certifiably-robust models by generating small perturbations that the models are (provably) robust to, yet that change an input's class according to human labelers. Finally, we formally show that the existence of excessively invariant classifiers arises from the presence of overly-robust predictive features in standard datasets.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/ije56i/d_fundamental_tradeoffs_between_invariance_and/

31,[Discussion] Grad probability or grad analysis- which class to take?,Savings_Criticism,1598769834,"Hello,

I'm going into my second year as an undergrad math+cs major. Looking to pursue grad school/research in something in the intersection of math/cs, though I'm not really sure which area yet. Last year I took a year-long sequence in introductory advanced calculus/analysis using Folland's *Advanced Calculus,* with baby Rudin as a reference. I am debating whether to take a year-long, graduate-level course sequence on analysis (measure theory and integration, functional analysis, complex analysis) or probability theory for this year. Both have the same prereq of undergrad analysis. I would like help deciding which class to take this year. I have some questions:

1. Which class would be more helpful for research in some mathematical area of cs- theory of computation/algorithms/machine learning/formal language theory/etc.? I would guess probability theory, but is this necessarily true?
2. Which class would look better for (cs) grad school applications? It seems like real analysis would be better for building the strongest/broadest mathematical foundation possible, and it might have a reputation for being more rigorous (it's a core first-year class for math phd students, whereas advanced probability isn't), so would not having taken the analysis sequence look bad? Would the analysis sequence be perceived as more rigorous?
3. Would taking both sequences be too redundant? They both seem to spend about one quarter on measure theory and integration, though I would guess they have different focuses.

I'm thinking of using 2 or 3 GTX 1080

From what I read elsewhere, GPUs can be parallelized and one of the specs to keep in mind is the  PCIe, however in this article:

 [https://timdettmers.com/2018/12/16/deep-learning-hardware-guide/](https://timdettmers.com/2018/12/16/deep-learning-hardware-guide/)

it says ""  I can tell you if you have 96 GPUs then PCIe lanes are really important. However, if you have 4 or fewer GPUs this does not matter much"". So I'm not sure what to believe or if the above combo is any good. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other option would be to find somewhere a more expensive single GPU for \~800 $ 

I""m not sure how to decide,.... what would make one option better or worse than another?

&amp;#x200B;

Also is the  AMD Ryzen 9 3900X Matisse 3.8 GHz 12 Core AM4 processor advisable... or does the processor not matter much(other than maybe some pre-deep learning tasks)?

53,"[D] Interview about ""Increasing Generality in Machine Learning through Procedural Content Generation"" with authors Julian Togelius and Sebastian Risi",regalalgorithm,1598729669,"Julian Togelius and Sebastian Risi recently co-authored the survey paper [Increasing Generality in Machine Learning through Procedural Content Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.13071.pdf) , which is the focus of the [latest interview](https://aitalk.podbean.com/e/interview-togelius-risi/) of the ""Let's Talk AI"" [podcast](https://www.skynettoday.com/podcast). Abstract of paper: 

&gt;Procedural Content Generation (PCG) refers to the practice, in videogames and other games, of generating content such as levels, quests, or characters algorithmically. Motivated by the need to make games replayable, as well as to reduce authoring burden, limit storage space requirements, and enable particular aesthetics, a large number of PCG methods have been devised by game developers. Additionally, researchers have explored adapting methods from machine learning, optimization, and constraint solving to PCG problems. Games have been widely used in AI research since the inception of the field, and in recent years have been used to develop and benchmark new machine learning algorithms. Through this practice, it has become more apparent that these algorithms are susceptible to overfitting. Often, an algorithm will not learn a general policy, but instead a policy that will only work for a particular version of a particular task with particular initial parameters. In response, researchers have begun exploring randomization of problem parameters to counteract such overfitting and to allow trained policies to more easily transfer from one environment to another, such as from a simulated robot to a robot in the real world. Here we review the large amount of existing work on PCG, which we believe has an important role to play in increasing the generality of machine learning methods. The main goal here is to present RL/AI with new tools from the PCG toolbox, and its secondary goal is to explain to game developers and researchers a way in which their work is relevant to AI research.

From the applications shown, it seems like they use some AI algorithm to interpret these signals and classify them or make predictions about the next signals like a time-series.

* Classification  returns a matrix which has elements that have numbers assigned to them  based on what class the element belongs to. Each cell is ""a rectangular  frame in the original image"" (yet this is not conveyed in the matrix  expression).
* In  order to extract the classifications from the image, one needs to have a  geometric representation. Such as a data structure, which is like the  matrix, but where the elements are rectangles (e.g. corner 1, corner 2,  height, width).

13,[R] GPT-2 Position Embeddings Visualized,fpgaminer,1598649899,"https://i.imgur.com/GGNoayy.png

I've been exploring the internal behavior of GPT-2 and thought this image was worth sharing.  It's just a straight-forward visualization of the position embedding of HuggingFace's pretrained GPT-2.  Position is along the Y-axis (1024 positions), embedding along the X axis (768).

The periodicity along the Y-axis is quite odd.  It looks as if, for many dimensions on the embedding vector, it's learned something like `sin(position)`.  Strange.  For example:

https://i.imgur.com/XT6hiK4.png

Skimming through the dimensions they all form some kind of periodic function, it's just that some have significantly higher amplitude than others.  For example the 0th dimension as a std-dev of ~0.005 whereas the 19th dimension has a std-dev of ~0.442.  Yet both are periodic.

Along the position dimension, the 0th embedding vector has a significantly higher std-dev of ~0.357.  Everything else is closer to ~0.130, except for the 1023rd which is significantly lower at ~0.004.  The mean of all embeddings along the position dimension is ~0.

While I recall earlier Transformer models using periodic functions for fixed position embeddings, GPT-2 uses learnable, randomly initialized position embeddings.  So it's just really fascinating to see it learn periodic embeddings...

Also curious is that I'm able to train a smaller GPT-2 without position embeddings with no ill effects on test loss.  8 layers, 8 heads, 512 model depth, 512 context, 100 million tokens of WebText2.  Both with and without position embeddings I get a test loss of ~4.9.  That said, I'm not sure what effect that ablation would have on larger models or longer training; those are out of reach for my lone 2070.  For reference, HuggingFace's pretrained GPT-2 gets a test loss of ~3.3 on WebText2 with 512 context.  Perhaps the position embeddings are only needed at lower losses.  Would be neat if they aren't needed, though, as it would make inference significantly faster.

Typically with just one treatment and control, and one outcome, you can do a simple hypothesis test to evaluate the results.  When you have multiple tests, you can use models that share prior information.

Some people, [like these guys](https://netflixtechblog.com/computational-causal-inference-at-netflix-293591691c62), call the resulting model conditional average treatment effects or time dynamic treatment effects.

My group has been researching adversarial examples in NLP for some time and recently developed [TextAttack](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack), a library for generating adversarial examples in NLP. The library is coming along quite well, but I've been facing the same question from people over and over: *What are adversarial examples in NLP?* Even people with extensive experience with adversarial examples in computer vision have a hard time understanding, at first glance, what types of adversarial examples exist for NLP.

We wrote an article to try and answer this question, unpack some jargon, and introduce people to the idea of robustness in NLP models. **Here's the medium post:** [**https://medium.com/@jxmorris12/what-are-adversarial-examples-in-nlp-f928c574478e**](https://medium.com/@jxmorris12/what-are-adversarial-examples-in-nlp-f928c574478e)

Convolutional Neural Networks have dominated image processing for the last decade, but transformers are quickly replacing traditional models. This paper proposes a fully attentional model for images by combining learned Positional Embeddings with Axial Attention. This new model can compete with CNNs on image classification and achieve state-of-the-art in various image segmentation tasks.

nlp_input = Input(shape=(length_long_sentence,))

I added the LSTM layer because I’ve seen it used after the Embedding layer in text classification models and figures it may help my model.

For some context, I'd say that I understand the basics (model versus model-free, policy iteration versus value iteration, MDPs, etc...) and have a handle on some of the deep reinforcement learning methods (DQN, A3C, REINFORCE, etc...).

I'm currently trying to get a better handle of new research into deep RL. It seems to me that most modern research is either applying older methods (like DQN, A3C, REINFORCE, or some slight variant) to problems in new domains (robotics especially, but also NLP and vision) or some theoretical analysis of deep RL. **Is there active research in developing new deep RL algorithms or general training tricks for deep RL or neural network architectures which can be applied to all applications?** It seems that I either have to be an expert in theory or in some specific application to appreciate a paper's value, besides of course seminal papers like the Atari DQN one.

**For benchmarking the performance of various RL algorithms, what is the field standard?** For example, OpenAI gym seems to have a nice abstraction for a lot of different games and control and robotics environments, but I don't really see papers comparing their algorithm performance on some of these environments. Are they just too simple, and the applications people too focused on their specific application, while the theory people are unconcerned with benchmarking their analysis? 

Maybe I'm way off, or just looking in the wrong place, in which case some guidance would be very much appreciated :).

85,[D] Why one-hot encoding is a poor fit for random forest classifiers and ensembles of weak estimators in general,chris_conlan,1598571841,"
We know that random forests are collections of trees, i.e. *forests*. A tree might look like the following 

```
      o
    /   \
   o     o
  / \   / \
o   o  o   o
...
x x x x x x x x x x x x  ...
```
... where an `o` represents a node where a decision is made, and an `x` represents a prediction.

Say, for example, you had a dataset with 100 continuous features, and you wanted to add a mutually exclusive categorical label to each row of the training data. For example, you might have observations that are all different colors and you have ten binary features like `is_blue`, `is_red`, ... etc. for 10 total colors. Nothing can be two different colors.
In order for a single tree to make use of that information, it would have to do train following ...

```
                          is_color_1
                 is_color_2      is_color_3
   is_color_4   is_color_5      is_color_6    is_color_7
is_color_8    is_color_9      is_color_10   ...    ...   ...   ...   ...
```
This is bad because it eats up 3 layers of tree depth just to categorize the observations. Tree depth is expensive because the number of nodes in a tree grows along `2^n` for depth `n`. Many trees are relatively shallow even for complex estimators (around 5, 6, or 7 layers deep).

So, this represents a huge sacrifice in predictive power.

Further, since random forest use average many many trees, you'll undoubtedly get trees where certain categorical variables are excluded. So, you are also sacrificing accuracy along the horizontal axis. Given 1000 trees, it may be that only a 10th of your trees make effective use of the color variable.

```
tree_1 tree_2 tree_3 ... tree_999 tree_1000
```


In conclusion, when it comes to random forest classifiers and mutually exclusive one-hot encoded categories, you are not gonna do well. You sacrifice power in too many places for it to be helpful.

*  I've been trying to finetune VGG16 as an encoder, as that's what the repo above did, but I'm confused why they didn't use ResNet50 or something like that?

Maybe the author of that original StyleGAN post is still around here and could chime in on some general tips for training the encoder? Like batch size etc., I found the repo code quite hard to understand at first glance and it seems to assume 8 GPUs, at most I have access to 5 GPUs right now.

Does anyone have any tips on how to train this encoder? Or maybe a pre-trained one exists already which I haven't been able to find?

I've already trained the VGG16 encoder for 6 epochs batch\_size=32, and the results do start to improve, but the decoded images on CelebA are pretty blurry (or should I say noisy?), any idea how to improve this?

For example while this data is unbalanced the distribution of classes is somewhat similar to reality and since Bayes Theorem takes into account the basic probability of a Class in its formula would balancing all the classes be a smart decision?

Binary classification task. My colleagues all follow the rule of 10, meaning you should select no more features than 10 x the number of samples in the minority class. This is supposed to protect against overfitting.

So I’m running 5-fold cross-validation, and limiting the number of selected features to 3 gives worse CV-performance than 4 or 10 or 100. There becomes a limit when my classification performance dies, but only for SVM. KNN &amp; LDA don’t seem to care. For feature selection, I’m testing three different approaches: t-test, MRMR &amp; recursive feature elimination (using linear SVM).

If more features gives better CV-performance, then this tells me that more features are improving the generalizability of my model than fewer features. 

I understand how more features increases model complexity and at some point will just give you perfect training performance, but if more features give me better CV-performance, than why should I follow the rule of 10?

2: It does generate meaningful text to your prompt hints like GPT-3 at kmer=64.

3: However, I found that the generated texts does exists (partially or full) on the Web. For large kmer what it  does is to smoothly join your hint with an existing paragraph. 

4: I hear that given some number of some states, GPT-3 generates whole table of all states in US. This leads to my doubt that GPT-3 excels by memorization/copying. If copying is the way, then GPT-3 is the no more than knnlm.

5: for middle sized kmer and temperature, knnlm shows interesting  mixing effect. It paste small segments (\~6 words) from different part of the corpus and join them smoothly.

25,[D] How valid are automatic/semi-automatic image annotations?,bpmsilva,1598531673,"I'm currently annotating an image dataset together with three other persons and it has been very time-consuming. If we want to finish everything in 3 months, each one of us will need to dedicate 15 hours a week! Someone raised an idea to save us some time: manually annotate part of the dataset, train a neural network, and use its predictions to annotate the rest of the dataset. In this approach, we would only need to correct the wrong and poor predictions of the network. However, I'm not completely in favor of this approach, because I think this could lead to some problems such as (i) worse quality of the annotations than the manual ones, (ii) less acceptance of our results by the community, (iii) bias in favor to solutions similar to the network used to generate the annotations (Do you agree with these points?). I know that there are some automatic annotations tools, such as the Polygon-RNN++, but I don't see them used too much in practice. Also, these tools seem to work well with ""easy"" to annotate objects, such as cars, which is not my case. I would like to hear your opinions on this issue and, if possible, could you share your experiences when having to annotate a large dataset. For instance, is it common to spend a lot of time (more than an entire month of work) annotating datasets?

50,[D] Multiclass Multinomial Naive Bayes with Unbalanced Data,ayoungtadpole,1598504839,"I have used sklearn to create a basic multiclass naive bayes text classifier. I have 3 classes and around 800 rows of data. Class A has 564 rows, Class B has 159, and Class C has 82. As you can see the data is unbalanced among the classes and I understand that this can affect the accuracy because Bayes Theorem takes into account the probability of a word occurring in the text given that the text is of a specific class in order to figure out the probability of the text being of said class given that it has the word in the text. This was my first go, and I plan to get more data, as you might imagine Class A was the easiest to get while Class C was the hardest to attain. 

I am however confused as to how I should be approaching creating and improving this model and how balanced the class data sets should be. If I were to get perfectly proportionate data for each class say 1000 rows of data for each class, or undersample the data i already have, wouldnt this affect the accuracy as well? Since in reality, the occurrence of Class C is actually definitely less likely than A and B. In reality the proportions of the classes are somewhat similar (although varying from person to person) to the probability of a text being of said Class. And since the Bayes Theorem also takes into account the Probability of a piece of text being a specific class in order to calculate the probability of a text being a specific class given that it contains a word, wouldn't creating a balanced dataset with equal number of rows for each class decrease the accuracy as the probability of a class occuring in production is not taken into account as the probability is now essentially constant and the same for all classes since they occur equally. Although making all classes equal does remove the bias of a word due to unbalanced datasets.

 So I am unsure how to approach creating this model efficiently as I feel with unbalanced data, common words in Class C are perceived by the model to be more likely to occur in an email of Class A when in reality they are probably more common in C but the skewed data is creating this bias. On the other hand, making the classes balanced ignores the actual probability of a piece of text being a specific Class although I have no way of calculating a universal probability of each class that is accurate for all individuals, (does that mean that making the classes balanced has less of a negative effect on accuracy?).

52,[P] Time Series Model building for production site data,ysharm10,1598503641,"Hello! I'm trying to build a predictive model for work. The model should predict the number of orders that'll be delayed. The data is from a production site. Delay means if the time taken to produce an order takes more than target cycle time. And there are hundreds of order in a day with different target ct and elapsed time. Now, these are the two fields I have in database, target ct and elapsed time. 
But the way I'm predicting till now is from a data that comes from a dashboard (Qlik). Qlik expression (If Elapsed time/Target CT &gt;1 then lagging flag =1, order is delayed) calculates if an order is delayed and then sum all the orders for the day. So, from qlik data, I have two columns, Date and number of delayed orders for that day. I have only tried building Arima models from the qlik data and forecasting is not accurate at all. I'm using JMP btw, since qlik data wasn't that huge.

Can you guys please tell me if I'm even towards the right direction because the Order number will change everyday so no correlation between order being delayed and order number.

70,[R] Hyperparameter Tuning for Transformer Models,dahdarknite,1598488523,"Hi all!

Recently there’s been some discussion about how to efficiently tune hyperparameters for large transformer models where even running one iteration is pretty expensive. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ibrlvt/d\_how\_do\_ml\_researchers\_make\_progress\_when/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ibrlvt/d_how_do_ml_researchers_make_progress_when/)). It seems like companies that can afford it use more sophisticated approaches but the vast majority of people end up just doing a naive grid search over a few different hyperparameters.

I tried out a couple hyperparameter algorithms and found that [Population Based Training](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/population-based-training-neural-networks) could sizably increase model accuracy without increasing the tuning budget (for certain tasks). 

I wrote up my experiences and a couple tips in this [blog post](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/hyperparameter-optimization-for-transformers-a-guide-c4e32c6c989b) leveraging [Hugging Face transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) and [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune.html).

71,[D] Odd Questions Regarding Transformer (NLP),kavinda14,1598487828,"The goal of asking these questions is to try to find intuition behind certain ideas in the Transformer architecture.

1. **Regarding Decoder layers**: I understand that there can be N number of Encoder layers. This is also true for the Decoder. With the Encoder, it makes sense to have N layers because along with the Multi-Head Attention, the N layers of Encoder allow the model to refine its attention on different words. Why does the Decoder need N layers though? Is it because each Nth layer of the Encoder produces different values for the attention matrix and thus allows the Decoder to use these different attention matrices to derive an output?
2. **Regarding the specific number of Layers of Decoder and Encoder**: Can the Decoder and Encoder have a different number of layers? In the „Attention Is All You Need“ paper and other articles I have read online, they seem to use the same number of Encoder and Decoder layers. What would be the logic of using a different number of Decoder layers compared to the Encoder?
3. **Regarding Q, K, V in Masked Multi-Head Attention Layer (Decoder)**: Since the Decoder is being fed its own output, why do we need to run it through the whole self-attention layer again?

The quality and accuracy of the algorithm fascinated me far more than I was expecting. I've been playing with it for days.

Could a general-purpose transformer be trained and run on a  decentralized network, similar to digital currencies? Obviously, running such a massive network is quite different from data validation like blockchain, but I imagine a few principals can be carried over. Instead of mining for crypto, the user would be training or running the network.  In exchange for computing power, the user would receive query uses.  (I.e. for each 10 compute units preformed, the user could make one query  request to the network)

I imagine in the future, pre-trained transformers will become much larger and more common, especially for other mediums like images, video, and sound.  So it makes sense that working with something of this scale would be worth looking into.

Data is the modern gold. Neural classifiers can improve their performance by training on more data, but given a trained classifier, it's difficult to tell what data it was trained on. This is especially relevant if you have proprietary or personal data and you want to make sure that other people don't use it to train their models. This paper introduces a method to mark a dataset with a hidden ""radioactive"" tag, such that any resulting classifier will clearly exhibit this tag, which can be detected.

Abstract:  Because learning sometimes involves sensitive data, machine learning algorithms have been extended to offer privacy for training data. I  practice, this has been mostly an afterthought, with privacy-preserving models obtained by re-running training with a different optimizer, but using the model architectures that already performed well in a non-privacy-preserving setting. This approach leads to less than ideal   privacy/utility tradeoffs, as we show here. Instead, we propose that model architectures are chosen ab initio explicitly for privacy-preserving training. To provide guarantees under the gold standard of differential privacy, one must bound as strictly as possible   how individual training points can possibly affect model updates. In this paper, we are the first to observe that the choice of activation function is central to bounding the sensitivity of privacy-preserving deep learning. We demonstrate analytically and experimentally how a general family of bounded activation functions, the tempered sigmoids, consistently outperform unbounded activation functions like ReLU. Using   this paradigm, we achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR10 without any modification of the learning procedure fundamentals or differential privacy analysis.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/igwgf9/d_tempered_sigmoid_activations_for_deep_learning/

I'm quite new in machine learning and I have an issue that i'm not able to solve

I have two dataset, Dataset A (1523 data) and Dataset B (750 data). Each dataset is composed from 6 features that I want to use to predict a target value. My goal is to use dataset A as training dataset and dataset B as test.

As first test I run random forest regressor on both the dataset separately in order to first look if there is a correlation between the input features and the target. In both cases the model is able to do a good prediction.

However, when I try to use dataset A for taining and dataset B for test, the model do not work.

I think that the issue could be that training and testing features has different distributions. I attached a picture that show the different distribution between training (red) and testing (green).

Does anybody have any idea as to what can be a method of gauging the optimal number of clusters and feeding that to the function? 

Are there any statistical or mathematical solutions for this?

The approach is as simple as it could be (the goal is to get baseline):  features  are extracted once from training and validation sets and then passed through PCA and used as input for k-means. This alone gives almost state-of-the-art accuracy and ARI (adjusted Rand index).  In addition, same evaluation is performed for networks trained in a supervised manner. There is good correlation between linear classifier performance and k-means, except for bad performance of networks with very high-dimensional embeddings, which is possibly k-means fault.

Additional experiments are performed on ObjectNet. When using ImageNet training, the numbers are almost random or random (except BigBiGAN), even for supervised networks. Nevertheless, if k-means is trained on ObjectNet itself, it is possible to get non-trivial results (6.5% accuracy).  Interestingly, in this case there is no difference between accuracy on ImageNet classes and non-ImageNet classes.

*Excerpt:*

---
For this post, I’m going to take artificial general intelligence (AGI) to mean an AI system that matches or exceeds humans at almost all (95%+) economically valuable work. I prefer this definition because it focuses on what causes the most societal change, rather than how we get there.

In 2015, I made the following forecasts about when AGI could happen.

- 10% chance by 2045
- 50% chance by 2050
- 90% chance by 2070

Now that it’s 2020, I’m updating my forecast to:

- 10% chance by 2035
- 50% chance by 2045
- 90% chance by 2070

I’m keeping the 90% line the same, but shifting everything else to be faster. Now, if you’re looking for an argument of why I picked these particular years, and why I shifted by 10 years instead of 5 or 15, you’re going to be disappointed. Both are driven by a gut feeling. What’s important is why parts of my thinking have changed - you can choose your own timeline adjustment based on that.

Let’s start with the easy part first.

5. My preference is to use a GPT-3 Temperature setting of 0. However, the aforementioned site uses a Temperature somewhat greater than 0. To get an answer that is more likely to be the answer that would be given if the Temperature were 0, I will report the true/false answer for a given question as the winner from a ""best 3 of 5"" queries.

59,[D] anyone else think that there's a complete lack of rigorous resources/textbooks on Deep Learning?,tellmewhotolove,1598394097,"want to state up front that I'm referring specifically to Deep Learning as there are lots of rigorous texts on ML/statistical modeling.

but does anyone else feel this same way about deep learning textbooks?

I'm always seeing recommendations for the Deep Learning book, which I personally think is pretty subpar. Take a look at the [chapter on convnets](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/convnets.html), for example. There is no derivation of the backward pass ... only 1/4 of a page (of the 40 total pages) are devoted to backprop in a CNN. And in this 1/4 page, no derivation and no explanation is given, just two equations. As a comparison there is [this](https://www.jefkine.com/general/2016/09/05/backpropagation-in-convolutional-neural-networks/) great article that gives a derivation in full.

Imo a good textbook on DL would give the following 2 things at the start of each chapter on a layer:

1. a definition of `forward()` for the layer
2. a definition of `backward()` that derives backprop for the layer. (ie the derivation shows how  `grad_out` and `forward()` can be used to find `grad_in`, `grad_bias`, and `grad_weight`).

this is what's needed to understand the inner workings of a layer at a bare minimum ... why is it absent in all of these deep learning books?!

We've just released Cortex 0.19, and I wanted to share the repo here. If you've never heard of it before, Cortex is our open source platform for deploying prediction APIs. At a high level, it is designed to help:   


* **Define prediction APIs:** With straightforward Python, you can write APIs for realtime and batch inference, using one or many models, without worrying about model servers or framework compatibility. 
* **Deploy prediction APIs:** With a single `cortex deploy` command, Cortex will containerize your API, deploy it to a cluster (which Cortex also spins up for you), expose it as a web service behind a load balancer, implement autoscaling, and automate a number of other infrastructure components. You can deploy to any EC2 instance, including GPU, Inferentia, and spot instances.
* **Manage prediction APIs:** Cortex implements autoscaling, rolling updates, and log streaming for every deployment. It also supports A/B deployments, traffic splitting, prediction tracking, and performance monitoring.

You can see a demo here:

In 0.19, we've added several new features, including:

* Batch inference support
* Traffic splitting
* Improved cluster management

We've also added a bunch of new examples for you to play with if you're curious, like this YouTube object detector built on YOLOv5: [https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/tree/0.19/examples/onnx/yolov5-youtube](https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex/tree/0.19/examples/onnx/yolov5-youtube)

The Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI) is launching its Fall 2020 Seminar Series. The theme of the seminar series is Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity, and our first speaker is Dr Nicholas Carlini, from Google Brain. Dr Carlini received his PhD from UC Berkeley. He works on developing attacks on machine learning systems, demonstrating security and privacy risks of those systems. He has received numerous best paper awards, and his work has been featured in the New York Times, the BBC, Nature magazine, Science magazine, Wired, and Popular Science. An abstract from Dr. Carlini's presentation is included below. We look forward to seeing you there for his exciting talk.

**Stealing Neural Networks With Model Extraction Attacks, Dr. Nicholas Carlini**

**Abstract**

Neural networks have recently become sufficiently accurate across a wide range of tasks that they are now deployed in many practical settings. In order to protect their intellectual property and security, these models are often only released through black-box prediction APIs, or when they must be released on-device, are stored encrypted or obfuscated.

In this talk I develop the techniques necessary to steal neural networks by directly extracting their parameters. Unlike attacks that train a copy of a neural network to behave similarly on most inputs, model extraction attacks recover a functionally equivalent model that behaves identically on all inputs. For example, we can extract a hundred thousand parameter model that behaves matches the original with at least 25 bits of precision.

I conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical consequences of such attacks, along with the directions for future work necessary to scale these attacks to more realistic environments.

Abstract:   Because learning sometimes involves sensitive data, machine learning  algorithms have been extended to offer privacy for training data. In  practice, this has been mostly an afterthought, with privacy-preserving  models obtained by re-running training with a different optimizer, but  using the model architectures that already performed well in a  non-privacy-preserving setting. This approach leads to less than ideal  privacy/utility tradeoffs, as we show here. Instead, we propose that  model architectures are chosen ab initio explicitly for  privacy-preserving training. To provide guarantees under the gold  standard of differential privacy, one must bound as strictly as possible  how individual training points can possibly affect model updates. In  this paper, we are the first to observe that the choice of activation  function is central to bounding the sensitivity of privacy-preserving  deep learning. We demonstrate analytically and experimentally how a  general family of bounded activation functions, the tempered sigmoids,  consistently outperform unbounded activation functions like ReLU. Using  this paradigm, we achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST,  FashionMNIST, and CIFAR10 without any modification of the learning  procedure fundamentals or differential privacy analysis.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/igh6gh/d_tempered_sigmoid_activations_for_deep_learning/

14,[P] What is the best approach for phrase detection in speech audio?,JoshMam,1598340692,"I ultimately want to build an application like this:

Inputs:

* a list of written phrases of 1-5 words each
* a bunch of audio files like mp3, with total duration in the 100 to 1000 hours range, and potentially thousands of separate files, all in English, moderate audio quality.
* specify whether to check for the presence or absence of each phrase

Output:

* A list where a True/False result is given for each phrase / audio file combination

The obvious approach to me is to use a speech processing API, generate a transcript for every file, then search for each phrase in each transcript.

I don't have any experience with speech processing so I'm looking to be pointed in the right direction, to know if there are best practices for my specific use case etc, is ""audio phrase detection"" a thing or does it just come under speech processing? Any answers to the following questions would also be very helpful:

* Are there existing APIs/services out there that already do what I described (the transcribing but also handle the phrase searching component)
* Are there specific speech processing algorithms best suited to long durations like this? What sort of runtime can I expect?
* What sort of error rates should I expect? False positives vs False negatives
* Any impact from using different filetypes (mp3 vs wav) on accuracy, speed etc?

Academics get all the hype, but engineering get very little exposure.

So here's a thread for ML engineering. Some of the things you could talk about are:

- what does your stack look like?
- what were some programming patterns you found useful?
- what are some tools, libraries etc that helped you (besides model training)?
- what did you struggle with and how did you fix it?
- how do you manage your data, artifacts, generated embeddings, data dependency, serving, logging?
- what API or tools have you built? (For your use or the service exploiting the predictions)
- What blog post did you enjoy?
- how did you get your pipeline up and running in the beginning?

I've been instructed to read this paper: [AdaS: Adaptive Scheduling of stochastic gradients](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06587.pdf) and I had some questions:

**Defn 1**:

\- This is my first experience with tensor decomposition, and was confused about what 'low-rank singular values' means?

\- why is the tensor only in 4 dimensions? if its the weights of the conv layer then it should have as many dimensions as there are kernels/filters right?

\- what do they mean by 'knowledge gain across *a particular channel'*? Is this referring to the depth of an image?  It's the particular channel (dth dim) of the tensor representing the weights of the conv so kinda confusing - especially since the tensor should only have 4 dimensions?

**Defn 2:**

\- what does "" low-rank singular values of a single-channel convolutional weight"" mean (same q in 1)

**Semi-related qs:**

\- what is a 'superblock'? How does it defer from a block?

Thank you for your help!

Exploiting symmetry in structured data is a powerful way to improve the learning and generalization ability of AI systems, and extract higher quality information, in applications ranging from vision, imaging, and NLP to robotics. This is exemplified by convolutional neural nets, which are an ubiquitous architecture. Recently, there has been a great deal of progress to develop improved equivariant and invariant learning architectures, as well as improved data augmentation methods. There has also been progress on the theoretical foundations of the area, from the perspectives of statistics and optimization.

Reinforcement Learning is a powerful tool, but it is also incredibly data-hungry. Given a new task, an RL agent has to learn a good policy entirely from scratch. This paper proposes a new framework that allows an agent to carry over knowledge from previous tasks into solving new tasks, even deriving zero-shot policies that perform well on completely new reward functions.

72,[D] Solving the graph similarity problem using machine learning,temporary-egg,1598172776,"Hello everyone,

  
I am currently trying to explore a number of options to solve a problem. The description of the problem is that I have a database of directed graphs (finite state machines) where nodes in each graph represent the state and arrows represent the state transitions. The graphs do not have labels. My goal is to check whether an arbitrary graph, which may or may not be from the database, is similar to any graph in the database. A naive solution could be to run a graph similarity algorithm for every graph in the database; however, this approach is infeasible since the graph similarity problem is computationally expensive. Therefore, I was wondering if there exists an appropriate machine learning solution for this problem. My initial thoughts about using machine learning are that I will first train my model on the database of graphs to learn about the graph level embeddings. And while the prediction phase, I will input an arbitrary graph to the model and find its embeddings and then somehow calculate whether the given embedding is closer to any other embedding of a graph in the database. 

  
So fellow redditors, what are your thoughts on this? I need your feedback and guidance on how to approach this problem.

Also, in the end, I want to make a binary decision on the similarity scores by defining a certain threshold as well.

77,[D] Relevance of researchers in a compute driven world,Kalsir,1598169852,"To me there seems to be a strong trend that the most succesful AI projects are increasingly coming from large companies investing millions into compute and hardware infrastructure, one of the most recent examples being GPT-3. Rich Sutton expressed similar sentiments in his essay ""The bitter lesson"". These kind of projects are completely out of reach for university based researchers. Of course one could research the final models created by these companies (if they make them available at all), but I have no doubt that other companies are working on even bigger language models right now. I expect this divide to become bigger as more viable commercial opportunities open up. Progress in AI then seems more driven by commercial funding than the work of individual researchers at universities.

I cannot recommend enough the just-released preprint of the book on Graph Representation Learning by Will Hamilton (McGill): 

https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/

I was proud to have served as one of the reviewers of this book, and ever since I've been super enthusiastic to recommend it to everybody! Will's writing style is beyond sublime and the explanations are incredibly clear. 

This book is hence an excellent learning resource for those new to the field (with a basic understanding of deep learning concepts), as well as an excellent textbook reference for practitioners already in the field! I brushed up quite a bit on the relations between GNNs and PGMs, for example :)

Despite its fairly recent resurgence, GRL is already used to discover novel potent antibiotics, power web-scale recommender systems and strengthen autonomous vehicle systems! Both the research and applied aspects are ripe with low-hanging fruit, and we've just started to get some high-quality benchmarks (such as OGB/Benchmarking-GNNs), hence the time is perfect to jump in on the action. :)",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/iezafd/r_graph_representation_learning_book_by_will/

99,[D] Training a single label classifier on images that have multiple labels,BartTrzy,1598143892,"I'm training an image classifier on the COCO dataset, where images often contain examples of multiple classes (e.g., dog AND truck AND person). 

When training a single label classifier (softmax output layer, categorical crossentropy loss), how should the training examples be labeled? I have been repeating images with multiple labels, each with a single label at a time.

So, an image of ""dog and truck and person"" would be repeated three times, once as ""dog"", once as ""person"", and once as ""truck"". But I imagine this is not a sound strategy.

Another option is to create a y value with 1.0 as the value for each present category, e.g. \[1,1,0,1\] if there are 4 labels (person, dog, airplane, truck) and the image has three of them (person, dog, truck). This doesn't strike me as particularly sound either given that softmax normalizes the entire vector to 1.

Recently, there has been a great deal of progress to develop improved equivariant and invariant learning architectures, as well as improved data augmentation methods. There has also been progress on the theoretical foundations of the area, from the perspectives of statistics and optimization.  The notion of adding data via data augmentation also arises in problems such as adversarial robustness. This workshop will bring together leading researchers in the area to discuss the state of the art of the field.

#### [Facebook’s AI for detecting hate speech is facing its biggest challenge yet](https://www.fastcompany.com/90539275/facebooks-ai-for-detecting-hate-speech-is-facing-its-biggest-challenge-yet)

Facebook has made significant progress recently to proactively take  down content that violate its community standards. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, Facebook took down 104.6  million pieces of content. While reviews are typically performed by a vast workforce of human  moderators, AI-powered tools have enabled Facebook to do this work at a  greater scale for textual content.

However, there’s a long way to go for these systems to match or  exceed the capabilities of human moderators. This is because a large proportion of hate speech and misinformation is  in the form of images and memes, and reasoning about the context and  language-image interplay is an extremely difficult challenge for AI.

&gt;Given Facebook’s scale and the speed at which some use it to spread  hate, incite violence, and share lies with millions, Facebook will have  to keep running to catch up.  
 

#### [AI Slays Top F-16 Pilot In DARPA Dogfight Simulation](https://breakingdefense.com/2020/08/ai-slays-top-f-16-pilot-in-darpa-dogfight-simulation/)

The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) recently hosted a  simulated F16 dogfight competition, with different AI bots competing  with each other as well as with human pilots. The top AI bot was able to beat a human pilot 5-0 in the simulated  contest. DARPA started this program “as a risk-reduction effort \[…\] to flesh out  how human and machine pilots share operational control of a fighter jet  to maximize its chances of mission success.” Competition runners are broadly optimistic about the demonstration of AI  capabilities, even if they are not close to being deployed on a real  aircraft. Of concern, the program had little discussion on the ethics of AI  military applications, especially with the lethal autonomous weapon  systems being considered.

13,[D] The competition for ML jobs is due to a lot of non ML people applying for them,not_an_assholereally,1598124090,"I recently saw a LinkedIn post from a recruiter hiring for Machine learning engineers at a top tech company. The job was research/engineering position and required knowledge of TensorFlow/Keras CNN/RNN (you know, the whole deal). The post had over 2000 comments from interested applicants. Surprised that there were so many people applying for ML jobs, I took a look at the profiles of people applying.

To my surprise, they had very few or no machine learning projects/exp on their resume. Forget if they have a degree/self-learned, they were basically front end developers or have SQL/AWS knowledge applying for these jobs. A lot of them didn't even have python on their resume!  I even saw a few MIS (i guess it's a mechanical field) applicants apply for these jobs!

I'm not saying these people shouldn't apply for ML jobs, but I believe there are a lot who're applying to get on the hype train, **without even learning ML/doing some projects by themselves.** It won't help them, but it's just hurting actual applicants.

In my college we have this Career day where a lot of companies set up booths and hire people. Since 2-3 years there was not a single booth for ML jobs. I asked a few recruiters and they have the same answer - there are too many applicants. Again - not qualified applicants, but too many. Before that (before the field got hyped) my seniors got hired directly on Career day. Now in my batch we have to send hundreds of resumes out and maybe get a few calls.

Knowledge distillation has been used primarily to compress deep learning models but recently has found applications in tasks such as improving robustness of models as well.    
[KD\_Lib](https://github.com/SforAiDl/KD_Lib) is a modular open-source PyTorch library to facilitate knowledge distillation (KD) for custom deep learning models.  The inspiration behind developing this library was the absence of any comprehensive framework allowing users to train their models using KD easily. KD\_Lib takes care of the entire distillation training process and has a vey simple and intuitive API. It contains a variety of methods from a collection of prominent research papers which can be used with a few lines of code.

However, a normal GPR gives a distribution over samples from a function. For instance, one would expect that the dataset looks something like D= (X,Y) = ((x1,y1,z1, x2,y2,z2, x3,y3,z3), (F1,F2,F3)), if we would try to predict the force value based on the joint position. 

Here, in this paper, the data set is defined as D= (X,Y) = (initial position, state of the system) =((x0,y0,z0, x0,y0,z0, x0,y0,z0), (x1,y1,z1,F1, x2,y2,z2,F2, x3,y3,z3,F3)). I don't understand how the prediction works at all, if the X is a set of static values i.e. the initial position.

64,[D] Help with ML in industry,Vermeille,1598062114,"Hello everybody,

I'm a DL PhD student having a job as a ML engineer in a small company. I am a fairly decent programmer; actually, I used to be a software engineer before diverging to ML.

The thing is, the ML team in my company is composed of me, myself and I. And I have never been trained in industry ML or data pipelines. The resources, in terms of talks, tutorials, blog posts, courses, about ML in production at small scales seems to be in much lower quantity than academic papers.

In fact, since I started this job, there wasn't a day I felt confident about what I was doing. I am all alone and there's no senior ML eng I can ask my questions to, so I'm just wandering trying to find my way by myself. Here are some questions I struggle(d) with:

&gt; In general:

&gt; - given that I directly access a server with ssh, how do I version my data? What tools do I need for reproducibility?
&gt; - What is worth iterating on? I spend a lot of time iterating on loss functions and hyper parameters, does this bring any value usually?

&gt; When training a face recognition system for tagging videos:

&gt; - When I hit what seems to be the maximum performance of a CNN doing face rec, and it's not good enough for production, what do I do? Every single book, class, or paper I read is about training and evaluating your model. It never talks about iterating, improving, and refining your model. If that CNN is not good enough, what do I do? Do I just say that the project should be aborted and that money has just been wasted?
- That model computes embedding similarity to recognize people. The ""database"" of face embeddings is a pain to maintain. What are the tools that exist for that kind of things? How do people usually store vectors in db? How to compare an incoming embedding to all embeddings in that database? Make sure that the model and the precomputed embedding vectors are in sync?

&gt; On a recommender system:

&gt; - How to access a fresh store of the things we have to recommend? How do ML products usually access those (and their computed features representations) quickly, efficiently, tagged with the model's version, and resilient wrt ML service failure?

I'm not asking for answers -those questions are likely uninteresting for most people here- but mostly for resources on those kinds of questions that will probably help a lot of people. I believe these know-how are mostly transmitted from person to person in companies but being the first ML eng in my company without prior experience, I am struggling a lot. I need to go way beyond ""train your model, evaluate it, and call it a day"".

Thank you very much, I am kinda desperate as of today and I am severely doubting my own skill. Before just giving up and going back to being a SWE, I want to make sure I exhaust every resource there is.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/iea8r0/d_help_with_ml_in_industry/
65,[R] Taming pretrained transformers for eXtreme multi-label text classification,ch3njust1n,1598058338,"New X-Transformer model from Amazon Research

&gt;We consider the extreme multi-label text classification (XMC) problem: given an input text, return the most relevant labels from a large label collection. For example, the input text could be a product description on Amazon.com and the labels could be product categories. XMC is an important yet challenging problem in the NLP community. Recently, deep pretrained transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks including sentence classification, albeit with small label sets. However, naively applying deep transformer models to the XMC problem leads to sub-optimal performance due to the large output space and the label sparsity issue. In this paper, we propose X-Transformer, the first scalable approach to fine-tuning deep transformer models for the XMC problem. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on four XMC benchmark datasets. In particular, on a Wiki dataset with around 0.5 million labels, the prec@1 of X-Transformer is 77.28%, a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art XMC approaches Parabel (linear) and AttentionXML (neural), which achieve 68.70% and 76.95% precision@1, respectively. We further apply XTransformer to a product2query dataset from Amazon and gained 10.7% relative improvement on prec@1 over Parabel.

68,[D] Help with bone semantic segmentation,juniorjasin,1598057717,"Hi, I'm Anibal and I'm a software developer.

Since a few month I was working with computed topographies scans (CT scans), we are creating a 3D representation of the bones using semantic segmentation, what we did is train a unet (the original version [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf)) neural network (with around 7000 thousand for training and 400 for validation) , with the trained model we predict slice per slice (only in a sub range) and with that we create the 3D model representation, and is working fine.

What I'm curious about is what can we do next to improve the quality of the predictions and also the speed of the predictions, any advice? the only requirement that we have is that this needs to work in a machine with only CPU. Our prediction time is around 0.7 secs per slice with images of 512x512.

I was thinking and trying this:

\- using a mobilenetv2 to detect the area we want and predict using smaller images, but that give us a poorer quality, not that bad but in this case quality is a little more important than speed. I tried 384x384, 256x256, 192x192, 128x128, of course the speed improved a lot.

\- I was thinking in using 2.5D input since it seems to be more precise and not that difficult to train.

\- Also, perhaps using another variant of unet, but not sure how much we can gain with this

\- We will try to compile tensorflow to improve the speed

\- We didn't try hyperparameter tunning and I don't know how can far we can go with that

Many biomechanics and motor control researchers have studied motor control models using neuromechanical simulations, which enable physically correct motions in a musculoskeletal model for the purpose of analyzing the observed human motions. However, the team notes that DRL has rarely been applied in neuromechanical simulations to model human locomotion control, suggesting this has hindered the development of accurate motion prediction models.

Paper: https://github.com/seanmor5/vegan/blob/master/assets/VeGAN.pdf

I worked on this for my Honors thesis and thought I’d share the code and paper for others to look at. 

This approach treats upsets in NBA games as anomalies and uses the approach described in the AnoGAN paper to predict the likelihood of an upset. I was able to get some promising results, but the methodology definitely needs some improvements and further scrutiny.

I think applications of deep learning in sports betting are interesting and understudied. My initial approach used RL, but the agent just learned to bet $0 on every matchup. That was kind of an obvious result given the expected value of every line is guaranteed to be less than 1.

I have written a custom loss-function for this purpose. My aim was to save the model/its weights at the end of each \`epoch\`. For this, I am using [tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ModelCheckpoint).

&amp;#x200B;

`tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(`

`save_weights_only=False, mode='auto', save_freq='epoch', options=None, **kwargs`

`)`

&amp;#x200B;

In order to continue training at a later time, I need to save the `optimizer` state. The sure way to save the `optimizer` state is to pass `save_weights_only=False`, and use the `'tf'` or `'h5'` save\_format to save the entire model. I read [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/save_and_serialize#whole-model_saving_loading), that Tensorflow `SavedModel` format is the recommended method to save models. But, for some reason, using that format takes a lot of time, whenever the model is being saved at the end of each epoch (On the other hand, `save_format='h5'` saves the entire model pretty fast). Now, when I pass `save_weights_only=True` with `'tf'` format, it saves the weights as Checkpoints. I was wondering, if `save_weights_only=True, save_format='tf'` also saves the `optimizer` state? \[As far as I know, `save_weights_only=True, save_format='h5'` only saves the weights and not the optimizer.\]

Going through the docs, they mentioned [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load#save_checkpoints_during_training), that Checkpoints can be used to continue training, but I couldn't be sure about it.

[https://github.com/Feynman687/Interviews/blob/master/StatML.md](https://github.com/Feynman687/Interviews/blob/master/StatML.md)

FYI:  I have interviewed a lot, including Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon,  Bloomberg, Quora, Walmart Labs, Allen AI, a lot of  mid sized companies  in Bay area (SoundHound, PocketGems etc) , a lot of new 10 member team  startups in Bay area (Blue Hexagon, Well said labs) and more. The list  is a combination of all the topics (statistical ML only) that I  encountered in those interviews. Of course, you may or may not be judged  on all but knowing a bit on such topics is always a plus. For example, I  never knew much on reservoir sampling until I was asked to ""derive a  proof for it"" in a Data Scientist interview for one of the above  mentioned companies. If you're thinking why reservoir sampling - it's an  effective strategy to calculate Mean/Median etc characteristic for a  fixed number of samples coming from a NRT (near real time) feed .

Abstract: We investigate the effect of explicitly enforcing the Lipschitz continuity of neural networks with respect to their inputs. To this end, we provide a simple technique for computing an upper bound to the Lipschitz constant---for multiple p-norms---of a feed forward neural network composed of commonly used layer types. Our technique is then used to formulate training a neural network with a bounded Lipschitz constant as a constrained optimisation problem that can be solved using projected stochastic gradient methods. Our evaluation study shows that the performance of the resulting models exceeds that of models trained with other common regularisers. We also provide evidence that the hyperparameters are intuitive to tune, demonstrate how the choice of norm for computing the Lipschitz constant impacts the resulting model, and show that the performance gains provided by our method are particularly noticeable when only a small amount of training data is available.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/idy5q8/d_regularisation_of_neural_networks_by_enforcing/

36,[D] Creating a Detector from a Classifier in Pytorch,ralphieIsAlive,1598011754," Hi guys,

I'm trying to create an object detector detector in Pytorch from the ground up, the primary purpose for which is to detect circular objects on a dark background. My plan was to start with a working classifier, that I have already created and verified that it works. I used this tutorial as a guide: [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10\_tutorial.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html)

What I want to do next is implement a ""sliding-window"" like network that takes in an image tensor \[3, Height, Width\] where 3 is the rgb channels and outputs a tensor of sliced images \[n, 3, h, w\]. My classifier is designed to run on 32x32 images and I just resize the last 2 dimensions before running an image through it. Does anyone have any suggestions or references on how I could implement this sliding window system with pytorch?

Camera calibration (extracting intrinsic parameters: focal length and distortion parameter) is usually a mundane process.

If you have a set of cameras needed to be calibrated then you have to multiply the time required for one camera calibration by the number of cameras.

# How can we dodge this process?

By happy chance, there is a paper available at [ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3278471.3278479) that describes a deep learning approach for camera calibration. Using this method, the whole process is fully automatic and takes significantly less time. It uses a single image of a general scene and can be easily used for multiple cameras.

78,[P] - Clustering and regression on relational data with multiple (and varying number) parameters,Quantum_Sloth,1597958480,"I'm a software developer but my passion is data analysis and machine learning, I've been learning and practicing these skills in my free time for a couple of years now. Currently I'm working on a little project analysing my job's company database, trying to gather some information on correlations between different types of objects that we store. I've done some regression analysis on easily labelable data with not much success, most likely because I had to filter out majority of the available data that couldn't be labeled. Now I'm trying to work with a much larger dataset, however assigning relations between objects is something I've been scratching my head and Googling for a while with not much success. 

To expand the size of the dataset I'm gathering, the features that I've chosen have one to many relationship within the dataset, so each object could have 0 to few category labels assigned to it, and there's no way to prioritise them as all of them have comparable importance. 

Each of these parent objects have a long list of related child objects, each of which also have one to many relation to the same category along with some metrics which I am planning to use for training my model. 

Here's a simplified and generalised example of source tables I'm working with:

Parent object table:

|Parent Object ID|Category|
|:-|:-|
|1|Category A|
|2|Category B|
|2|Category C|
|3|Category A|
|3|Category D|

Child object table:

|Child Object ID|Parent Object ID (FK)|Category|Metric|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|1|Category E|Metric Value|
|2|2|Category B|Metric Value|
|2|2|Category E|Metric Value|
|3|3|Category A|Metric Value|
|3|3|Category B|Metric Value|

The categories in both parent and child object tables are the same category, where Category A of a child object equates to the same Category A of a parent object.

As my knowledge in this area is still quite limited, I'm struggling to figure out what types of algorithms would suite this problem and how to structure this data in a way that would allow me to either run some regression analysis trying to identify what category correlation results in highest metric value, or trying to cluster that data to find relationship between what child groups have stronger relation to what parent groups. 

It's quite hard searching for solutions or advice to this problem, maybe my definition of it is too vague, but also it's not something I encountered in any of the courses or articles that I've read. So any help or suggestions about what to do, or just pointers in the right direction is greatly appreciated! 

Thank you very much in advance.

8,What path should be pursued to build career in field of Intelligent Automation? Confused! [D],pranavsnr,1597933499,"Hi,

I am an RPA (Robotics Process Automation) engineer who primarily works on tools like Uipath, Blueprism. It mostly involves rule based office automation. The job is becoming pretty boring for me, as all the use cases are very much similar in nature. And since it is rule based automation, there is no brainstorming involved, it's just developing code based on certain business rules.

Now, I am planning to progress my career and move a step ahead and I want to venture into the territory of 'intelligent automation'. I have been doing some reaserch and I was comming across a lot of terms like Machine Learning, AI, Data science etc., But now I am confused on choosing the right path for me. My ambition is to work in a product company or start my own and build highly automated and intelligent self learning systems that can solve complex problems. It can be developing deployable recommendation engines, or complex image recognition and processing system. 

Currently I have some basic knowledge of Python, Probability and statistics. I know I need to learn much more. Reading so much has made me confused, so could you please let know which path I should pursue and which courses should I start of with so that I can progress my career in the right direction

So I am a graduate student in a quantitative field. As an elective, I can take an Introduction to Machine Learning class that my university offers.

Also, the course will be done in python which I am fairly unfamiliar with. I do, however, have a working knowledge of R and am competent in linear algebra and multivariate calculus. Also, the teacher said the code will be taken mostly from libraries rather than being written from scratch.

So basically I am wondering if I will be totally lost and should not take this class? Like I really want to because I feel like it is right up my alley, but I don't want to get in there and be totally f\*cked.

Background: Recently got a first in maths/cs from a fairly good UK uni, applying for masters in oxbridge, with hopes of becoming a ML researcher one day.

(Mainly talking about oxbridge, but not exclusively). Im thinking that theres 3 degrees i can take, ML, CS or Stats. Now, im not exactly sure how much stats/prob is needed, but i didn't take any stats/prob past first year, is that enough?

Most CS degrees will offer 1/2 ML modules with some applied stats but won't go as far into details/applications. If i take one im sure there will be areas in the other two that ill need that im missing. So am i better off taking ML and learning the missing CS and stats on the side? or is it the other ways round? The 50/50 people saying ML is/isn't just hype isn't really helping.

Also try playing the [guessing game](https://game.postdoesnotexist.com/) (guess if the comment is generated by the AI or written by a human).

With such amazing AI systems as AlphaGo, youtube's recommendation algorithm, and self driving cars, we truly have reached the pinnacle of artificial intelligence. But now, I present to you the magnum opus of AI; an artificial intelligence so advanced, so incredibly amazing, that it has nothing on daddy elon. I present to you the pornhub comment generator.

## Why?
A couple years ago, a company called OpenAI released a text generation model called GPT2. It's this massive model that was trained on a massive dataset of English text scraped from the internet, and it turned out that this model was REALLY good for text generation—so good that OpenAI was scared to initially release the model. So naturally, I figured, well with such cutting-edge tech as this, I need to put it to good use. And what better way to test an AI's capabilities than to have it make some pornhub comments.

## Dataset
An over 300 MB collection of pornhub comments scraped from pornhub links referenced on r/pornhubcomments.

For TIFU and WP posts, they were scraped using the Reddit pushshift API.

## Method
We finetune GPT2-medium (345M parameters) on comments processed into a translation task format; each entry has a source and target sequence separated by a translation token (i.e. ``post_title&lt;|translation|&gt;post_body``. Additional separator tokens were used to condition the model on likes and author username in the case of pornhub comment generation.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/icwsxx/p_i_trained_an_ai_to_generate_pornhub_comments/
53,[D] Examples of training paper summarization on abstracts,bbateman2011,1597869189,"I have found a few works where they make use of the abstracts of papers in a process to develop an abstractive model for summarizing scientific papers, such as:

 [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03186.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03186.pdf) 

 [https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume10No2/Paper\_31-Automatic\_Structured\_Abstract.pdf](https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume10No2/Paper_31-Automatic_Structured_Abstract.pdf)

however I'm not finding examples of training a ANN directly on the paper with the abstracts as targets. I suppose the size of the input and output vectors might be an issue to do this with reasonable computational resources.  But I wondered if there are examples I've overlooked.

My high-level idea is that since nearly all papers for a long long time have abstracts, there is a readily available summary of every paper, so why not use that to train a model to automatically generate abstracts? I know there are issues like abstract quality, bias, lack of structure vs. structured, etc. but I wonder if this has been addressed and I'm not finding a lot so far.

Such systems however require a huge amount of data for training. DeepMind and McGill University researchers believe the problem could be solved through a strategic “divide-and-conquer” approach.

Here is a quick read: [DeepMind &amp; McGill Employ Operations Generalization to Divide &amp; Conquer Complex RL Problems](https://syncedreview.com/2020/08/19/deepmind-mcgill-employ-operations-generalization-to-divide-conquer-complex-rl-problems/)

62,[D] Waveforms vs. spectrograms as inputs to a Convolutional Neural Network: why do ML researchers tend to prefer the latter?,Probono_Bonobo,1597862239,"I had posted this to the stickied ""Simple Questions"" thread, but at the advice of someone who responded I'm reposting as a separate question.

My boss has two waveforms. He feels that there is a neural interpretation of the black box function that transforms waveform A into B.  That converting from A to B should be possible for a machine learning algorithm to do, provided sufficient amounts of simulation data. I am not at all convinced that this is possible, and in fact incredibly skeptical that it is. 

This is partly because I've noticed DSP-related neural networks almost always convert waveforms to spectrograms first, rather than training on the raw 2D waveform array magnitudes.

* [Vocal audio isolation using spectrograms and masked input layers](https://towardsdatascience.com/audio-ai-isolating-vocals-from-stereo-music-using-convolutional-neural-networks-210532383785)

* [Mitigating RF interference with CNNs (using spectrograms)](
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09077)

There's more, but these are pretty representative of the problem and the current state-of-the-art ML approaches.

My biggest question is, I would guess most ML practitioners writing on this problem would only go through that extra step of converting the underlying waveform in the raw training data to a spectrogram representation IF there were some underlying deficit in the CNN's ability to comprehend the raw input data.

65,[D] Advice about submitting a paper to conferences,kakushka123,1597861067,"Hi, I'm new to how conferences work. And I was wondering if someone could share some advice from his/her experience on the matter. Specifically, I was wondering about the things below

1. What is a 'workshop' in a conference? For example,  [https://edl-ai-icpr.labri.fr/](https://edl-ai-icpr.labri.fr/) . If I get accepted there, is that equivalent to getting accepted to ICPR in terms of recognition? What else does it involve?
2. Do you think it can be wise to try my luck to submit my paper to a top conferences to see if it gathers interest? And if so, how do I know which ones to submit to? and would it take long to do this process of application if there'll be apply=&gt;rejection=&gt;reapply to a diff conference cycle and all? Is it okay to submit my paper to all relevant conferences (maybe 5\~) at once and see how it does?
3. This is slightly off-topic, but my main goal is to get into to Cambridge next year, and I was wondering - do you think if I get to a top conference I have a higher chance of getting accepted to Cambridge than if I submit to, say, ICPR? Or is it more about the quality of the paper in the eye of the Cambridge guy that reviews my application, the references I get from my professors, and my grades that matter to increase my chances of my application being accepted?

67,[D] Should I apply for ML PhD? (I'm doing a CS master right now),hellooodarkness,1597860484,"Hello, so grad school application season is coming, and I'm still wondering whether I should apply for a PhD in ML. I hope this sub with many ML researchers and grad students may give me some advice. So some background info about me:

\- I've graduated a joint BS degree in Neuroscience and Computer Science. I'm doing a Master in the same field now. My school is considered a pretty good in ML (maybe top 10 but i'm not very sure).

\- My GPA is 3.84, not the best but I think it's ok. I've got several Bs in ML and algo classes tho.

\- I actually changed my major from BioEngineer to CS in my junior year (yeah, I know they're not very relevant. it took me lots of time and courage to make this decision). Therefore, sometimes I feel very behind compared to my CS friends.

\- I can read and understand most applied ML papers fine. I can re-implement the models and results. However, I have some troubles with understanding the math behind ML. I'm fine with usual calculus, probability and linear algebra, but don't really know vector calculus so I still can't derive by hand back-propagation through time. I feel not very confident with my math skills and worried that my math skills may not be enough to do ML research.

\- I've done 2 research experiences in my undergrads. The first one is not very related to ML, in which I implemented a software system to process electrode information recorded from monkey brains. The second one is related to NLP and we tried to use some new methods to interpret Transformer's internal representations. This research actually becomes an ICML paper with me as the second author. Honestly, we were all surprised that it got accepted, and I also don't really feel like I did that much work to deserved to become the second author .The students who started the paper, developed the pipeline and got like 60% result of the paper left for an industry job, then I came in and used the existing pipeline to do additional analysis to complete the paper. I only work in the project for 2 months. I feel that I just got lucky to be included in an almost finish project and become an author.

\- I'm working on adversarial machine learning now for my master thesis and I think I'm excited about the idea of the project. However, I don't really have lots of motivation to work hard and I procrastinate a lot. I'm supposed to work 8 hours per day for the project but I think I only have been working like 5 hours per day in this summer. I'm afraid that although I'm excited by new ML research and innovation in the field, I'm not motivated enough to survive and work hard in a challenging academic environment.

\- I'm also thinking about getting an industry job but I haven't done any internship and have only been doing research so far.

## Abstract

In gradient-based optimisation, the derivative of the loss of an example can be interpreted as the example’s effect on the update of a model. Consequently, a derivative magnitude function can be considered to provide a weighting scheme from the viewpoint of example weighting. Therefore, example weighting is universal in deep learning. Partially arising from the recent work on the risky memorisation behaviours of deep neural networks (Arpit et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017b), example weighting becomes an active research filed (Chang et al., 2017; Toneva et al., 2019). Example weighting has ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ versions: (1) ‘hard’ weighting is well-known as sample selection or mining, i.e., binary weighting; (2) ‘soft’ weighting means example differentiation using a continuous importance score.

In this thesis, we study how to learn more robust and discriminative representations using deep supervised learning. Technically, we propose example weighting for better optimisation and regularisation. Example weighting techniques differentiate and weight training data points according to a criteria, which varies in different scenarios. Example weighting improves the generalisation performance a lot, which is proved across multiple network architectures and learning tasks. We focus on two learning tasks in this thesis: learning to rank, and learning to classify. In both tasks, we reveal the importance of example weighting, by which a deep model focuses on more informative patterns, and pays less attention to non-informative (easy) and noisy (usually extremely hard) ones during the learning process. Therefore, example weighting is an important tool for guiding deep models to treat training samples differentially and learn meaningful patterns robustly and effectively.

Furthermore, our study on example weighting helps us understand better about the training data and a model’s learning process. When a training dataset is clean, naively assigning higher weights to harder examples works well. However, when the dataset contains both meaningful and wrong information, a model learns meaningful patterns before fitting random errors. The challenge becomes how to differentiate trusted and error patterns as training progresses, and avoid fitting the error transformation. We demonstrate that example weighting is an effective approach for addressing this challenge. Additionally, we empirically justify the effectiveness of our proposed example weighting methods in other adverse cases: (1) in-distribution anomalies, e.g., label noise; (2) out-of-distribution anomalies, e.g., input with no object of interest; (3) sample imbalance.

Hi, I'm working with a social science dataset about the academic performance of university students. There are many variables on the dataset (Gender, Vital records, education level of parents, attendance at lectures, hours dedicated on studying etc). I'm supposed to use techniques of statistical classification (It's the first time that I use classification techniques). In particular, I was trying to use a classification tree. Since I have to do predictions about the academic performance of students, I thought to consider the final grades of the students as my response variable. It is a discrete ordinal variable, based on a Likert Scale. In general, the variables I'm working with are all discrete variables. So I was seeking information about how to build a classification tree with these variables. First of all, I was thinking about the opportunity of dichotomizing this variable dividing its outcomes in ""Pass/Fail"" regardless of the specific evaluation with whom they passed the exams: is it a good idea? Then, I want to know how should I have to proceed to build a tree-based model to identify the groups people who are supposed to pass or to fail the year. I'm using R: I know that there are two famous packages ( rpart and tree) but I can guess there are also other packages to do this. What package do you use or advice to CART and tree-based models?",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/icn3gp/p_classification_and_decision_trees_for_beginners/

For comparison, the original ResNet20 had an error rate of **8.75%**. The performance of this 20-layer model is comparable with that of the original ResNet56 which was reported to have an error rate of **6.97%**.

I/we have this new approach that I thinks makes sense intuitively and works really well in toy tasks, but I can not really get it to work well in more difficult settings. Also it doesn't really have a strong theoretical basis.

Now I guess I have three options:

* just ignore the problems in difficult tasks and submit it as an idea that works well in toy tasks
* submit everything, working in toy tasks and having issues in complicated tasks and maybe get some insights from other attendees on how to make it work
* don't submit now and hope to somehow make it work in the future, although I don't have a clear plan on how to proceed.

I was wondering what most people here think about this. 

Of course, the second option would be more honest, but maybe also likely to just get immediately rejected? But then again workshops are also kind of for work-in-progress papers? I suspect most people in my situation would just submit without the problematic experiments, but maybe I'm too cynical about that.

I have some money to throw around and I don't necessarily care about a return on my investment; I can buy a handful of 4x RTX 3080 Ti computers and one or two 4x Quadro 6000, once the gpus come out, and other nvidia jetson dev kits and some equipment for an electronics lab

So I plan on beating gpu instance cloud prices and provide the best environment possible for a relatively small group of people to work together at a time and exchange ideas.

So my questions would be

1. If this was set up in your city would you be interested in becoming a member provided the cost of membership made it cheaper than cloud for you to train your models and gave you access to other equipment and data sets?
2. If 1. then what equipment would you like to see in the co-working office / lab?

However, when I added another set of numbers \[0.52, 0.18\] into the dataset, the generator can either only output one of the sets of numbers, or output numbers between the two sets of numbers

Is it possible for the generator to learn generating both number sets randomly?

(For example, either generating a set of numbers that is really close to \[0.1, 0.29\], or \[0.52, 0.18\], so that when I feed *z* into the generator for 10 times,  both of the sets appear in the results.)

91,[D] Is overfitting a problem if validation R2 is maximized?,yodel_anyone,1597745719,"I am trying to figure out how to deal  with overfitting in my data. Basically no matter what hyper-parameters I  tweak, I see a big discrepancy between my validation-set R2 and my  in-fit R2 (r2 \~ 0.8 for in fit, \~0.25 for validation). Typically this is a seen as a ""red-flag"" for overfitting, but  there is no way for me to close the gap between in- and out-of-fit R2  without lowering my overall validation R2.

Below  is the plot of validation R2 vs in-fit R2 for 15,000 different hyper-parameter combinations. The only way I can have maximum out-of-fit accuracy is by having a big discrepancy between in and out  of fit R2.

If we take overfitting  to mean ""poor performance on the test/validation data"" then it would  seem here that a big discrepancy between in- and out-of-fit R2 isn't  indicative of overfitting in this case. The only way I *don't* observe poor out-of-fit accuracy (relative to the max) is by observing an inflated in-fit R2.

So  is this something I should still worry about? If so, I've tried tuning  literally every parameter I can, so I'm at loss for how to proceed. Or  is this more of a semantic argument about what ""overfitting"" means?

I’ve been working on this for over a month now and I can’t get any decent ideas that I can stick with in terms of establishing a research question and applying it (regardless of whether it does very well in the competition or not, as long as it makes an interesting and useful paper)

At first, I thought of it as multimodal sentiment analysis, then didn’t find an innovative way to do that so I switched to just trying to augment the dataset (we only have 8000 images for training)

So, any ideas? I could use a discussion or any relevant work at all to get me on the right track. The zero progress in this challenge is really getting me down and it’s the first time I’m working on a multimodal project so I’d like to learn from it at least.

[D] [N]",BiochemicalWarrior,1597737080,"It's nice to see a concise implementation of [GPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT/blob/master/mingpt/model.py), in pytorch, as it is true Hugging Face's Transformer's is excellent, but it is quite difficult to trace. They are trying to build it out constantly with loads of features, so you get lost.

I'm wondering Andrej's reason for doing this? His wiki states he works for OpenAI and Tesla is at least affiliated with Openai. Also it's very far from computer vision domain, so why spend the time on an open source implementation and make some guesses on GPT-2/GPT-3.

His implementation is easy to follow, which is nice , most reimplementations I see have bugs or are unecessary complex. I am surprised at how basic his trainer code is etc., that he pretty much uses the very standard stuff.

Andrej also states 'A vanilla multi-head masked self-attention layer with a projection at the end. I believe I could have just used torch.nn.MultiheadAttention but their documentation is all but absent and code ugly so I don't trust it, rolling my own here.'

I usually trust the torch team blindly to come up with a more efficient implementation than I ever could, as don't they stringently test their code, before releasing? so am also surprised by this.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/ibwqht/andrej_karpathy_releases_concise_gpt/

30,"[D] How do ML researchers make progress when iteration cost is prohibitively high? (GPT3, Image-GPT, Autopilot, RL, etc.)",tmpberk,1597714451,"Today Andrej Karpathy released code for a minimal gpt implementation ([here](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT)), but what I found most interesting was his notes on the implementations. In particular at the end of the README he noted from the GPT-3 paper:
&gt; GPT-3: 96 layers, 96 heads, with d_model of 12,288 (175B parameters).

&gt; GPT-1-like: 12 layers, 12 heads, d_model 768 (125M)

&gt; We use the same model and architecture as GPT-2, including the modified initialization, pre-normalization, and reversible tokenization described therein

&gt; we use alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns in the layers of the transformer, similar to the Sparse Transformer

&gt; we always have the feedforward layer four times the size of the bottleneck layer, dff = 4 ∗ dmodel

&gt; all models use a context window of nctx = 2048 tokens.

&gt; Adam with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, and eps = 10−8

&gt; All models use weight decay of 0.1 to provide a small amount of regularization. (NOTE: GPT-1 used 0.01 I believe, see above)

&gt; clip the global norm of the gradient at 1.0

&gt; Linear LR warmup over the first 375 million tokens. Then use cosine decay for learning rate down to 10% of its value, over 260 billion tokens.

&gt; gradually increase the batch size linearly from a small value (32k tokens) to the full value over the first 4-12 billion tokens of training, depending on the model size.

&gt; full 2048-sized time context window is always used, with a special END OF DOCUMENT token delimiter

It's baffling to me how they determined this learning rate schedule, in tandem with all of the other specific choices (7 hyperparameters + architecture)

My background is in deep RL research where iteration cost is pretty high (a training run may take several days to a week). Choosing the right hyperparameters is crucial to the success of algorithms, but thankfully, the complexity isn't so high that we can still run hyperparameter searches. In fact, many researchers, me included, observe that we can keep many parameters discovered from ""exhaustive"" search from other problems frozen and reduce the complexity of a search to a few key parameters like learning rate.


On the other hand, given the huge size of GPT-3 and the training costs, it is obvious that OpenAI researchers could not have done a hyperparameter search to get their results (a single training run probably cost millions.) So in this paradigm of absurd iteration cost, how do researchers determine the set of parameters that end up working? Is there interference during the training process (resetting at checkpoints and starting again?) Do you do hyperparameter searches for increasingly larger models and guess at the trend for what works at a larger scale? 

So my question is: how do you iterate when true iteration isn't possible? My own experience as a grad student has been ""intuition"" from working with the models, but I feel increasingly with these large scale successes / fragility of RL that the deep learning community needs a more principled approach to tackling these problems. Or maybe it's just an industry secret, in which case I rest my case :) 

Related is (again) Karpathy's work at Tesla, which also works on difficult iteration costs, but is more dealing with multi-task issues:

What makes it challenging to use a decentralized approach to collectively optimize a central objective is the difficulty in characterizing the equilibrium strategy profile of non-cooperative games. To overcome this challenge, we design a mechanism for defining the learning environment of each agent for which we know that the optimal solution for the global objective coincides with a Nash equilibrium strategy profile of the agents optimizing their own local objectives. The society functions as an economy of agents that learn the credit assignment process itself by buying and selling to each other the right to operate on the environment state. We derive a class of decentralized reinforcement learning algorithms that are broadly applicable not only to standard reinforcement learning but also for selecting options in semi-MDPs and dynamically composing computation graphs.

It has been a while since I posted here like this! 

I'm here to let you know that your beloved open-source self-hosted automagically integrating experiment tracking platform has some new features you might be interested in. It is a grab-bag release with [bugfixes](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), some features we open-sourced from the enterprise solution and some features requested by our sprouting slack community ([join us!](https://join.slack.com/t/allegroai-trains/shared_invite/enQtOTQyMTI1MzQxMzE4LTY5NTUxOTY1NmQ1MzQ5MjRhMGRhZmM4ODE5NTNjMTg2NTBlZGQzZGVkMWU3ZDg1MGE1MjQxNDEzMWU2NmVjZmY)).

**Highlights**:  
1. `Optuna` support for hyper-parameter optimization controller. `OptimizerOptuna` is now the default optimizer.  
2. `AWS EC2` Auto-Scaler service wizard and Service.  
2. Enable the continuation of previously executed experiments (with proper safeguards).  
4. (finally!!!) Add offline mode. Use `Task.set_offline()` and `Task.import_offline_session()`  


**Personal favorites:**   
1. Allow procedural Task editing: `Task.export_task/import_task/update_task()`  
2. Fix plotly support for matplotlib 3.3  
3. Fix Task.set\_base\_docker() on main task to do nothing when running remotely.

I am curious about whether the ideas are sound or even reasonable. Please point out if something is already out there like this too. My googling didn't find anything, but maybe it's just my googling skills. 

## Goal
	* -- Calculate bias and variance of a model
	* -- Get a sense of a given predictive model's robustness to live data streams and it's vagaries

### Assumptions:
	* -- Focus on the simplest case first: a supervised regression problem with numerical variables

### Interface:
#### Inputs:
	* -- A csv file of input features/variables
	* -- A rest api endpoint of the model. (or a  command to execute the model?)
	* -- Actual output for each row is the csv file


#### Output:
	* -- Bias &amp; variance measure, formula similar to [this](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/evaluate/bias_variance_decomp/).


### How:
	* -- May be Use [tabular data augmentation](https://github.com/firmai/deltapy) to generate new data
  different from input data[^1]
	* -- Use [kernel density estimation](https://github.com/daithiocrualaoich/kernel_density) to guess
  the output data's pattern/distribution(from actual output) and use that distribution as the
  standard
	* -- Run a kde on each input data and generate new input data set using the kde estimates.
	* -- Run the model (via api) for the new data and get the output values.
	* -- Calculate the Bias and variance from comparing with the output kde as a standard.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm new to Pytorch and I'm trying to figure out a few things right now .

&amp;#x200B;

I have the following components :

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`

`...:`

`\`\_\_Python VERSION: 3.6.5 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Mar 29 2018, 13:32:41) \[MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)\]\`

`__pyTorch VERSION: 1.2.0+cu92`

`__CUDA VERSION`

`nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver`

`Copyright (c) 2005-2018 NVIDIA Corporation`

`Built on Tue_Jun_12_23:08:12_Central_Daylight_Time_2018`

`Cuda compilation tools, release 9.2, V9.2.148`

`__CUDNN VERSION: 7201`

`__Number CUDA Devices: 1`

`__Devices`

`Active CUDA Device: GPU 0`

`Available devices 1`

`Current cuda device 0\`\`\`

`\`\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

I'm using the following hardware and software :

\*\*Z440 G4\*\*

\*\*16GB RAM\*\*

\*\*NVIDIA QUADRO RTX 4000 (CUDA supported)\*\*

\*\*Windows server 2012r2\*\*

\*\*Anaconda 3.5.2 - Python 3.6.5 ( I need that specific version) .\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. After the installation of all the components I needed I searched for a training example just to make sure Pytorch is working . I executed the following :

&amp;#x200B;

`\`\`\`\`

`\`import torch\`

`import torch.optim as optim`

&amp;#x200B;

`model = torch.nn.Linear(5, 2)`

&amp;#x200B;

`Initialize optimizer`

`optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)`

&amp;#x200B;

`print(""Model's state_dict:"")`

`for param_tensor in model.state_dict():`

`print(param_tensor, ""\t"", model.state_dict()[param_tensor].size())`

&amp;#x200B;

`print(""Model weight:"")`

`print(model.weight)`

&amp;#x200B;

`print(""Model bias:"")`

`print(model.bias)`

&amp;#x200B;

`print(""---"")`

`print(""Optimizer's state_dict:"")`

`for var_name in optimizer.state_dict():`

`print(var_name, ""\t"", optimizer.state_dict()[var_name])\`\`\`

`\`\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

And got the following output

&amp;#x200B;

`\`\`\`\`

`Model's state_dict:`

`weight torch.Size([2, 5])`

`bias torch.Size([2])`

`Model weight:`

`Parameter containing:`

`tensor([[-0.1759, -0.2537, 0.1401, 0.2342, -0.3865],`

`[-0.2142, 0.2763, -0.2919, 0.2003, -0.3242]], requires_grad=True)`

`Model bias:`

`Parameter containing:`

`tensor([-0.0585, 0.2511], requires_grad=True)`

`---`

`Optimizer's state_dict:`

`state {}`

`param_groups [{'lr': 0.001, 'momentum': 0.9, 'dampening': 0, 'weight_decay': 0, 'nesterov': False, 'params': [935863832152, 9358638`

`31360]}]`

`\`\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

Next I have saved it by using :

\`\`\`

[`torch.save`](https://torch.save)`(model.state_dict(), ""`[`temp.pt`](https://temp.pt)`"")`

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

So far it seems OK to me . Anything else I can / Should check in addition ?

&amp;#x200B;

2 . How can I check in real time that my GPU is working ? I want to make sure PYTORCH is using the GPU and not the CPU . Anything I can check ? Saved log file maybe ?

However what I'm having trouble understanding is this: the agent is rewarded for having high prediction error, and at the same time it is supervised for having low prediction error, which seems a bit counterintuitive. Are those two kind of weight updates separate? I.e. first we teach the predictor to match the output of random network, then we reward it for high dissimilarity between prediction and random network output?

Last day I opened my computer and saw a weird thing. it said how a computer was able to generate precisely context-based jokes from just using a  transformer model, then I knocked my head and said ""what the hell was that it looks like a human said it"", then I remembered GPT-2(the master of lies) and said for my self ""If a raw transformer can create jokes then a GPT-2(again, trained with 40GB of human knowledge) can be more intelligently humourous while creating jokes, it's obvious that it could do so because well GPT-2 already knows a lot of grammar and human representation of things. So, I went and asked where could I get such dataset and just went with a google search ( jokes database GitHub )  funny but it worked... here's the result [https://github.com/taivop/joke-dataset](https://github.com/taivop/joke-dataset), I used the **reddit\_jokes.json** file. Then got into a google search again (Google Colab GPT-2 pypl) then opened the Google Colab made a new copy on my repo ([https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1naor0BgRj4Q9x0NKPjBT7kqBqK3aKOuS?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1naor0BgRj4Q9x0NKPjBT7kqBqK3aKOuS?usp=sharing)).  then joined the title and body as a one-liner attached by ""||"" then just made a list of them as lines and saved it in a file. then I went on training the model. here's the result

&amp;#x200B;

[RESULTS](https://preview.redd.it/7gl16qfb0jh51.png?width=967&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0656c69c247e08930e8c4983f71f68ce433fff2)

It amazed me so much that I am going to train it with 1M jokes.

So, here's what I think happened.

The transformer model pretty much used its first knowledge of transforming and aligning and even contextualizing raw list of BPE's and used it on the jokes while being trained, that allowed it to create human-like jokes that are pretty.

**Here's some evidence**

&gt;I asked my girlfriend if she knew what sex was like || she said that you can kiss her and she'll think you're a queer.

You can see this sentence and understand that the sentence before ""||"" is like a question and all the jokes in the prepared to train jokes are like this so the machine understood that changing the sentence before  ""||"" is much of underscored so I just got my computer and searched ""I  asked my girlfriend if she knew what sex was like"" on the list of sentences. amazing it's there but ""she said that you can kiss her and she'll think you're a queer"" was never there even searched from the half that means the ML model generated the best fit for the question,  interesting! huh.

**What about using prefixes**

&gt;Why does the teacher have her own car? || She's a car company for Santa.

I  used a prefix for the GPT-2 model which says ""the teacher have a car""  and so it got this. it's amazing how it could even generate a humourous answer for an unknown question because well it didn't overfit and the amazing part was the temperature was just set to **0.6.**

**My conclusion**

I think I just prove that Machine learning is being more humourous and contextual and that's very good.

coref = neuralcoref.NeuralCoref(nlp.vocab, conv\_dict={\[NEW\_WORD\]: \[\[CATEGORIES\]})

'''

However, it is nearly impossible for me to manually do so for every single new word, so I'm wondering if there is a workaround maybe using word embedding's vector representation. (Can you extract some categories from vector maybe using its distance feature? idk)

14,[P] Web based tool for simple class annotation of audio files,Novandrie,1597629161,"Hi!  
I work mainly in CV, but recently I was trying to learn how to work with audio data for a toy project involving audio classification. 

I had a few thousand unlabeled files that needed to be annotated for training. I looked around github for audio annotation tools but most were bloated with features that didn't fit my use case and needed a lot of setup (if anyone knows of a simple straight-forward one for audio classification, please tell me about it).

 Instead of spending one whole day opening up files and manually writing down their classes, I spent 5 days building AudioClass. A web-based tool made with the purpose of running with minimal setup and capable of speedy annotation. Here it is, I hope it helps in case anyone ever needs something similar:

29,[D]There are no good programming languages for machine learning (except one day C# and/or Kotlin),HugoRAS,1597609249,"Hi everyone, I’ve been spending some time recently researching next generation languages to do machine learning in, and come to the conclusion that there aren’t really any good options. Here’s my story. I strongly suspect I’m wrong about my opinions below, and so I especially welcome anyone who has countering opinions to my own, especially if I’m just downright wrong --- I’d like to know.

If you ask someone what the best programming language is, the chances are that they’ll tell you that it depends what it’s for --- they all have their strengths and weaknesses and quite naturally there’s no programming language that is both good for data science and operating system design.

When put like that, it seems like a natural thing: of course each language is a compromise, a heuristic to be optimised. If they’re better for security, then naturally they’ll be worse for something else. All is compromise and sacrifice is to be expected.

I disagree with that, or at least I disagree that the sheer level of sacrifice that today’s programming languages present, is necessary, and this article is meant to explain why. Disclaimer: I have multiple years of professional experience with C (in a Physics setting), Matlab, Javascript, Python, C#, Java and Kotlin (and yes, my career is long enough to have that many years in each). I have a month or two of Haskell experience. I have only got tens of hours of experience of Go and Rust.

I’m a C-programmer turned physicist, turned quant, turned data scientist, and so naturally, Python is a language I’m very familiar with, having spent years of my professional life using it. But I hate it. It’s literally a hundred times slower than the other languages I use, and the poor support for threads means that there are lots of tasks I just can’t do on it.

It basically means that I can’t do anything, uh, quirky with Python. I can’t easily try making a neural network other than those supported by my ML libraries, good though they might be. I can’t easily make a server that trains a model while keeping the client informed of how progress is going. Of course, if I look hard enough, I’ll probably find someone else’s library, that with a lot of effort might help me get 80% of the way there, but essentially, Python is a handicap here, not a help.

Ten years ago, my fallback language was C, and it still sometimes is --- it’s super fast and actually quite easy to get to grips with and program. But with large programs you can quickly find yourself spending a long time debugging, and it certainly wasn’t easy plugging and playing with libraries (perhaps the situation has improved).

Then I switched to C#, a jewel of a language that was uncool in cool circles because people were biased against Microsoft, but nevertheless, it took the best bits of C++, hugely simplified it, made it safer, and added excellent functional parts. It is concise and just a joy to program in.

Another jewel of a language is Kotlin: very similar to Java, but vastly better in terms of generics, functional style, boilerplate, and more (although there are rumours that Java is trying to catch up).

These two jewels, C# and Kotlin, really excel if you want to do fiddly messing around with dictionaries and lists. For instance if you want to load a bunch of trajectories and print the list of atoms ordered by the number of collisions they’ve had, or convert from a list of dictionaries to a dictionary of lists or from a class with three lists to a list of classes. These things would be really fiddly to do in the other languages here, but C# and Kotlin make them simple. And yes, they’re far more powerful than Python’s comprehensions.

And these two languages are fast --- almost as fast as C, depending on whether you’re using SIMD well in C, and both allow concurrency.

So what’s the catch? The catch is that everyone else is using Python, so Tensorflow / torch don’t really support them that much (I believe you can export a trained model, but you can’t easily train your own models in them).

This is tied in to the fact that neither language has good native support. If you’re trying to write the fastest atomic simulation in the world, and you want to mess around with the GPU and SIMD, these two languages aren’t yet going to be the best choice. It is worth pointing out that both languages can, technically, compile to native and interop with native, but the story is complicated by imperfect performance and tricky bits.

Then there are Golang and Rust. These are great languages, but Rust spends too much effort on making safety paramount. That’s great if you’re trying to write a browser or land a real spaceship, but I concluded that if I want to make physics simulations and do ML in it, the overhead from the language was just too great. Then Go is too simple. Generics and things aren’t implemented, and there are annoying things like not being able to compile anything with unused variables in it, and I don’t want to have to fight with the compiler on pedantic stuff like that. I don’t want my production code to have unused variables, but who cares if I’m programming some random simulation iteratively?

And neither have that great an ML picture either, as far as I can see: You still can’t train tensorflow models in them easily, and neither have a natural syntax for expressing maths.

And that’s more-or-less it. There aren’t really any other languages in the top 10-30 languages by popularity that could be used for machine learning realistically. Javascript’s kind of slow, and as a language is kind of ugly (in my opinion).

So what’s the solution? Kotlin and C# are the best languages in my fairly experienced opinion, by ease of use vs the power of the language, and there don’t seem to be any real reasons why these can’t be used for machine learning. As someone with years of experience in Python, C# and Kotlin, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Kotlin and C# are easier to write moderately sized (1000 lines) programs than python, and give you that flexibility to actually write the core algorithms yourself, rather than using someone else’s library (and hoping they’ve done a good job).

The world needs to shift focus onto these two languages, including making ML libraries for them, getting the two languages fully native (or equally fast), building up the GPU picture, and needs to stop only using Python as its ML language. Unfortunately we are not there yet, but this has to be the direction of travel if we don’t want a generation of machine learning experts stuck in a language where they can’t write machine learning algorithms.

So yeah, learn Kotlin or C# and do ML in it.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/iazlw9/dthere_are_no_good_programming_languages_for/

61,[Discussion] PyTorch favors Intel against AMD's rising?,ekerazha,1597568347,"PyTorch packages (both pypi and conda packages) require the Intel MKL library. As you know, Intel MKL uses a slow code path on non-Intel CPUs such as AMD CPUs. There was the MKL\_DEBUG\_CPU\_TYPE=5 workaround to make Intel MKL use a faster code path on AMD CPUs, but it has been disabled since Intel MKL version 2020.1.

PyTorch relies on Intel MKL for BLAS and other features such as FFT computation. Because pypi and conda packages require Intel MKL, the only solution is to build PyTorch from source with a different BLAS library. However, it looks like this isn't really pain-free (e.g. see  [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/32407](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/32407)).

Moreover, if you look at issues like [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/37746](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/37746) or  [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/38412](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/38412), it seems like they basically don't care about this problem.

Do you guys think there would be any utility in giving a neural network the ability to make an ""early"" decision? Take a simple CNN dog vs cat image classifier. Obviously CNNs are black boxes, but for simplicity of illustration, imagine the CNN learned the following sequence of rules:

1. Extract animal from image
2. IF animal is orange THEN animal is cat (let's assume no orange dogs exist)
3. IF animal has whiskers THEN animal is cat ELSE animal is dog

For a particular image, say the animal is orange. This would mean that the CNN could logically return after step 2 and not perform step 3. In a crude sense, it might mean that the next CNN layer need not be computed.

I know this sounds unpragmatic and possible silly, but I'd love to hear if anyone has any input on letting the CNN learn to return its decision early. I would imagine that during training, it would incorrectly return early, and then eventually learn the rules that must be satisfied before returning early.

2,[D] Word Mover's Embedding: Cheap WMD For Documents,vackosar,1597508410,"#  Word Mover's Embedding: Cheap WMD For Documents     

19 Jun 2020

&gt;*What is Word Mover's Embedding for documents and how it approximates Word Mover's Distance between documents.*

Word Mover’s Distance captures the semantic similarity between  documents more accurately than the cosine similarity between word vector  averages.  However, vanilla WMD has cubic computational complexity, which makes it  impractical in many applications. How WMD works? Why is it so good? Is  there any low complexity approximation of WMD?

### What is Earth Mover’s Distance?

It is minimum amount of dirt multiplied by distance needed to transform one pile of dirt into another pile of dirt.

Despite the earth in the name, better analogy is that of a  transportation problem.  Good example of transportation problem is cost optimization of  transportation of gold ore from mines to refineries, where each refinery  can accept only certain percentage of the ore.

Earth Movers Distance is also a distance metric between probability  distributions. So the problem above can be restated into following question. How to  transform the this geographical distribution of gold ore to this  geographical distribution for the least hauling cost?

Earth mover distance computational complexity is super-cubic as can be found in [Network Flows: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Network-Flows-Theory-Algorithms-Applications/dp/013617549X). There are papers on approximating EMD with [quadratic complexity](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/kusnerb15.pdf) in general case and [linear complexity](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/atasu19a/atasu19a.pdf) in document search if pre-computation is allowed.

### What is Word Mover’s Distance (WMD)?

Word Mover’s Distance is like Earth Movers Distance but between text documents.

* The probability distribution is over word vectors of the document’s words.
* The probability is normalized frequency of unique words in the document.
* The distance between word vectors can be a cosine similarity or euclidean distance.

Words vectors in above can be for example Word2vec embeddings.

### Word Mover’s Distance vs Word Embedding Weighted Average Similarity

Word Embedding Weighted Average Embedding is a vector calculated as frequency weighted average of word vectors in a document. The similarity measure used for WEWA is cosine similarity.

What works well currently is the newly released Huggingface zero-shot learning (https://twitter.com/huggingface/status/1293240692924452864). I provide a list of tags and it finds the best ones pretty reliably. But then i need to build the tag list by hand, which I'd rather avoid.

I guess there's also TF-IDF, but then I would need a corpus of documents. While I have a number of them already, I'm not sure if it'll still work if I suddenly have to handle very different product descriptions (ie distribution shift). Which is why I'd rather rely on a pre-trained model.

**Abstract** 

In recent years, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have won numerous contests in pattern recognition, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Neuron in ANNs is designed by the Knowledge about the biological neurons in the brain 70 years ago.Neuron in ANNs is expressed as f(wx+b) or f(WX). The design of this architecture does not consider the information processing capabilities of dendrites. However, recently, studies shows that dendrites participate in the pre-calculation of input data in the brain. Concretely, biological dendrites play a role in the pre-processing for the interaction information of input data. Therefore, it may be time to perfect the neuron of ANNs. According to our previous studies (Gang transform), this paper adds the dendrite processing section to neurons of ANNs. The dendrite processing section can be expressed as Wi,i-1Ai-1 ○ A0|1|2|...|i-1 . The generalized new neuron can be expressed as f(W(Wi,i-1Ai-1 ○ A0|1|2|...|i-1)) .The simplified new neuron be expressed as f(∑(WA ○ X)) . After perfecting the neuron, there are so many networks to try. This paper shows some basic architecture for reference in the future.

Interesting things: (1) The computational complexity of dendrite modules (Wi,i-1Ai-1 ○ Ai-1) after being connected in series is far lower than Horner's method. Will this speed up the calculation of basic functions in computers? (2) The range of sight of animals has a gradient, but the convolution layer does not have this characteristic. This paper proposes receptive fields with gradient. (3) The networks using Gang neurons can delete the full connectional layer of traditional networks. In other words, the parameters of the full connectional layers are assigned to a single neuron, which reduces parameters of a network for the same mapping capacity.

17,"[P] New Vulkan FFT library - VkFFT (open-source, crossplatform, faster than cuFFT)",xdtolm,1597494451,"Hello, I would like to share my take on Fast Fourier Transform library for Vulkan. I have posted this on some other reddits, but thought you guys might be interested too. Many convolutions in ML are calculated directly with multiplication of small kernels, however for big kernels FFT method is usually employed. It is based on the convolution theorem in the frequency space, where direct product of a padded kernel and an input system will produce convolution after the inverse FFT. This is what has been implemented in this library. If there is enough interest, the support of direct convolutions can be added later, which will open up a possibility to create a Vulkan-based alternative to cuDNN library.

Due to the low level nature of Vulkan, I was able to match Nvidia's cuFFT speeds and in many cases outperform it, while making VkFFT crossplatform - it works on Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPUs. It also has support for many useful features in addition to embedded convolutions, such as R2C/C2R transforms and native zero padding. The library uses WHDCN layout.

github repository: [https://github.com/DTolm/VkFFT](https://github.com/DTolm/VkFFT)

Some of the features, that can give an insight of how VkFFT works and why it is extremely fast:

1. Each multidimensional FFT is decomposed into the set of 1D FFTs. This is a common approach to the problem. Each 1D sequence from the set is then separately uploaded to shared memory and FFT is performed there fully, hence the current 4096 dimension limit (4096xFP32 complex = 32KB, which is a common shared memory size). This is the reason why VkFFT only needs one read/write to the on-chip memory per axis to do FFT. It also allows to perform FFT in-place.
2. All memory accesses are non-strided. This is a very important part, as GPU can upload 32 nearest floats at once. For this, to perform FFT in strided directions (y or z), we have to transpose the data, which takes time roughly equal to one read + one write. As there is only power of two sizes, the transposition after some permutations on the sequence elements can be done in-place with no performance loss.
3. If sequence has a length of &lt;=256, we don't have to transpose the matrix. The non-strided access can be acheved by grouping 16 nearby complex numbers or performing 16 FFTs at once. This is the reason why small FFTs are so fast in VkFFT. However, this optimization messes up with the memory layout (see picture on the main page) but if you plan on doing convolutions, output data will return to the way it was before.
4. Convolutions. They are embedded in the last axis FFT, which reduces total memory read/writes by 1.
5. As the register file is usually bigger than shared memory (256KB) I have an implementation that relies on it for FFT, using shared memory as a communication buffer. This allows to do 8K and 16K sequences in one go, which is planned for the next update in a few days.
6. To summarize, most of the time is taken by data transfers from graphics card memory to the on-chip memory, and not by the FFT computation itself (I think it is close to 80% of time). This is why it is so advantageous to have explicit memory control provided by Vulkan API. For 256x256x256 FFT there are only 3 reads and 3 writes, which is an absolute possible minimum right now. The convolution for this system will only take 5 reads/writes (+kernel upload).

**Abstract**

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to rely more on local texture rather than global shape when making decisions. Recent work also indicates a close relationship between CNN's texture-bias and its robustness against distribution shift, adversarial perturbation, random corruption, etc. In this work, we attempt at improving various kinds of robustness universally by alleviating CNN's texture bias. With inspiration from the human visual system, we propose a light-weight model-agnostic method, namely Informative Dropout (InfoDrop), to improve interpretability and reduce texture bias. Specifically, we discriminate texture from shape based on local self-information in an image, and adopt a Dropout-like algorithm to decorrelate the model output from the local texture. Through extensive experiments, we observe enhanced robustness under various scenarios (domain generalization, few-shot classification, image corruption, and adversarial perturbation). To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the earliest attempts to improve different kinds of robustness in a unified model, shedding new light on the relationship between shape-bias and robustness, also on new approaches to trustworthy machine learning algorithms.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/i9ynp6/d_paper_overview_informative_dropout_for_robust/

This paper proposes the width-resolution mutual learning method (MutualNet) to train a network that is executable at dynamic resource constraints to achieve adaptive accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Our method trains a cohort of sub-networks with different widths using different input resolutions to mutually learn multi-scale representations for each sub-network. It achieves consistently better ImageNet top-1 accuracy over the state-of-the-art adaptive network US-Net under different computation constraints, and outperforms the best compound scaled MobileNet in EfficientNet by 1.5%. The superiority of our method is also validated on COCO object detection and instance segmentation as well as transfer learning. Surprisingly, the training strategy of MutualNet can also boost the performance of a single network, which substantially outperforms the powerful AutoAugmentation in both efficiency (GPU search hours: 15000 vs. 0) and accuracy (ImageNet: 77.6% vs. 78.6%).

In particular, I am interested in the detailed practices of practitioners rather than popular marketing-friendly depictions of ML and AI. Your motivations, insights, and strategies would be an incredibly valuable addition to this research project.

**If you are willing to participate in an initial interview, would you be willing to DM me or email me (included at the bottom of this post).** Interviews tend to last about 30-60 minutes and can be conducted by phone or video chat (e.g., zoom). I would need to have you digitally sign a consent form, which I can provide should you decide to participate.

I am happy to answer any questions you have. For more information about me, you can click on the link to my webpage at the bottom of this post. Additionally, I am dedicated, as well as required, to uphold the highest levels of privacy for research participants, especially if you choose to remain anonymous. As an academic researcher, I can offer you no monetary incentive for your participation, but I am happy to share the published results of this work with you when it’s completed.

The principle form of dissemination of the data in this project will be conference presentations, academic journal articles, academic book chapters, and an academic book-length project. Audio and/or video data will not be disseminated, unless participants explicitly agree.

I look forward to hearing from you. I would also appreciate it if you might be willing to forward this message to anyone you know that might be interested in participating in this study.

Sincerely,

John

Open Domain Question Answering is one of the most challenging tasks in NLP. When answering a question, the model is able to retrieve arbitrary documents from an indexed corpus to gather more information. REALM shows how Masked Language Modeling (MLM) pretraining can be used to train a retriever for relevant documents in an end-to-end fashion and improves over state-of-the-art by a significant margin.

If I then include new data (i.e. from the next 24 hours), how do I deal with this? Do I run the clustering algorithm again now including this data? Do I turn it into a classification problem by obtaining more features? How often would it be reasonable to just rerun the clustering?

But when it comes to documents with complex structures, their outputs are usually not usable: this is because they are not optimized to parse the complex layouts of the contents.

To solve this problem, we build the tool [layout-parser](https://github.com/Layout-Parser/layout-parser) with deep learning. Trained on various heterogeneous document images dataset, it can help you identify the most challenging layouts like papers, magazines, etc. It can even help you identify the web contents in screenshots using the pre-trained models.

3,[D] Hidden Gems and Underappreciated Resources,DeepEven,1597407954,"Hey everyone, I’ve seen a lot of resource sharing on this subreddit over the past couple of years. Threads like the [Advanced Courses Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/fdw0ax/d_advanced_courses_update/) and this [RL thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/h940xb/what_is_the_best_way_to_learn_about_reinforcement/) have been great to learn about new courses. 

I'm currently working on a project to curate the currently massive number of ML resources, and I noticed that there are courses like CS231n or David Silver's that come up repeatedly (for a good reason). But there seems to be lots of other quality resources that don't receive as much widespread appreciation.

So, here are a few **hidden gems** that, imo, deserve more love:

**Causal Inference**

* [Duke Causal Inference bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/c/ModUPowerfulConceptsinSocialScience/playlists) (2015): Over 100 videos to understand ideas like counterfactuals, instrumental variables, differences-in-differences, regression discontinuity etc. Imo, the most approachable and complete videos series on Causal Inference (although it's definitely rooted in an Economics perspective rather than CS/ML, i.e. a lot closer to Gary King's work than Bernhard Schölkopf's). 
* [Elements of Causal Inference](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-causal-inference) (2017): A textbook that introduces the reader to causality and some of its connections to ML. 200 pages of content on the cause-effect problem, multivariate causal models, hidden variables, time series and more. Alternatively, this [4-part lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvrcyqcN9Wo&amp;t=1296s) by Peters goes through a lot of the same topics from the book. And for a more up-to-date survey of Causality x ML, Schölkopf's [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10500) will be your best bet.
* [MLSS Africa](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC722CmQVgcLtxt_jXr3RyWg/videos) (2019): Beyond a collection of other great talks, this Machine Learning Summer School has recorded tutorials on Causal Discovery by Bernhard Schölkopf and Causal Inference in Everyday ML by Ferenc Huszár. For an even more recent causality tutorial by Schölkopf, head to this year's virtual MLSS [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBOgpkDhQuYeVVjuzS5Wtxw/videos).
* [Online Causal Inference Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiiOj5GSES6uw21kfXnxj3A/videos) (2020-present): For a collection of talks on current research, check out this virtual seminar. Talks by researchers like Andrew Gelman, Caroline Uhler or Ya Xu will give you an overview of the frontiers of causal inference in both industry and academia.

&amp;#x200B;

**Computer Vision**

* [UW The Ancient Secrets of CV](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjMXczUzEYcHvw5YYSU92WrY8IwhTuq7p) (2018): Created by the first author of YOLO, this is likely the most well-rounded computer vision course as it not only teaches you the deep learning side of CV but  ""older"" methods like SIFT and optical flow as well.
* [UMichigan Deep Learning for CV](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r) (2019): An evolution of the beloved CS231n, this course is taught by one of its former head instructors Justin Johnson. Similar in many ways, the UMichigan version is more up-to-date and includes lectures on Transformers, 3D and video + Colab/PyTorch homework.
* [TUM Advanced Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLog3nOPCjKBnjhuHMIXu4ISE4Z4f2jm39) (2020): This course is great for anyone who has already taken an intro CV or DL course and wants to explore ideas like neural rendering, interpretability and GANs further. Taught by Laura Leal-Taixé and Matthias Niessner.
* [MIT Vision Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLMiFkFyfcNnZs6iwYLPI9g) (2020-present): A bunch of recorded videos of vision researchers giving talks on their current projects and thoughts. Devi Parikh's talk on language, vision and applications of ML in creative pursuits as well as Matthias Niessner's talk on Yuval Bahat's talk on explorable super resolution and some of its potential applications were quite fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Deep Learning**

* [Stanford Analyses/Theories of Deep Learning](https://stats385.github.io/lecture_videos) (2017 &amp; 2019): This one was mentioned in the Advanced course thread, but only linked to the 2017 videos. Whether ML from a robustness perspective, overparameterization of neural nets or deep learning through random matrix theory, Stats 385 has a myriad of fascinating talks on theoretical deep learning. It's a shame most of these fantastic lectures only have a few hundred views.
* [Princeton IAS' Workshops](https://www.math.ias.edu/sp/sycoe) (2019-2020): The Institute for Advanced Study has held a series of workshops on matters such as new directions in ML as part of its Special Year on Optimization, Statistics and Theoretical Machine Learning. Most of these wonderful talks can be found on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/videosfromIAS/videos).
* [TUM Intro to DL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ8Y4kIIbzy_OaXv86lfbQwPHSomk2o2e) (2020): If the advanced CV course is a bit too difficult for you, this course (taught by the same professors) is the corresponding prerequisite course you can take prior to starting the advanced version.
* [MIT Embodied Intelligence Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnXGbvgu9071i3koFooncAw/videos) (2020-ongoing): Similar to MIT's Vision Seminar, but organized by MIT's embodied intelligence group. Oriol Vinyal's talk on Deep Learning toolkit was really neat as it was basically a bird's eye view of Deep Learning and its different submodules.

14,[D] Why is it said that VC theory is vacuous when it comes to deep learning?,niszoig,1597400607,"According to the VC theory, the probability of the in-sample error being a good estimate of the out-of-sample error depends on the **number of samples(N)** we draw and also the **complexity(VC dimension)** of the hypothesis set we use. Having more samples is always a good thing.

Considering the sheer number of parameters it has, the *effective VC dimension* of a deep neural network is very high(even after taking regularization into account).

It is said that deep neural networks should be overfitting, but they somehow get good accuracy on the test set and hence ***generalize well***.

My questions:

* Suppose we get 99 percent test accuracy on the MNIST dataset using a deep neural network. Why does the **same** network not perform well on inverted MNIST (flip the foreground and background colors)?
* 
The answer to the above question could be that inverted digits are *not from the same distribution* the network is trained on. I argue that they **are** digits regardless. Am I right in believing that it should not matter if the classifier is tested on samples *that are from a different distribution* as long as the ***""essence""*** of the samples is a digit? 

* An *image of a digit drawn in the sand with a few seashells around* would still be a digit, and the ability to correctly classify such out of distribution images would be generalization in the truest sense? The **true out-of-sample error** of our classifier could be *much worse* than the error we get in our test set.

15,[D] Accounting for self-selection bias in a model,Optimesh,1597399597,"example:

you have a dataset for an app that can be installed on a phone, tablet and smart TV. Each row is unique on a user id, and you get various info, such as which device(s) the user uses the app on (can be 1 or more), and some continuous variable to serve as target, like longevity (# months user is active) or total spend on the service.

&amp;#x200B;

You want to know how much each device contributes to the target variable. This would inform a decision whether to try to push users to install the app on multiple devices, and which ones.

The problem is that there's a self selection problem with the data. More engaged users are exactly the ones that would install the app on more than one device at the first place. Hence, it's not clear that using the app on more than one device \_is\_ what makes the target variable move.

55,[D] - Usefuless of multiple optimizers in practice?,notthatkindofmap,1597347805," 

Has anyone had success using more than one optimizer for a single deep learning model?

As an example, say we wanted to train VGG19 on ImageNet, and we used RMSProp on the convolutional layers and SGD on the FC layers.

My understanding is that both optimizers would seek to minimize the loss (Cross-Entropy for classification), but the weights in the convolutional layers would be updated according to RMSProp and the FC ones would be updated according to SGD. The steps would be

1. Forward pass
2. Get loss
3. RMSProp on Convolutional layers, SGD on FC layers
4. Repeat

Has anyone found this to be effective? Detrimental? Intuitively I worry about the weights in the two blocks of the networks ""missing useful information"" that would otherwise be present. At the very least, this would add to the training time (though I'd imagine not by too much).

I do see one potential upside - ResNet was an advancement over VGG19 because of the skip/residual connections, because having an arbitrarily deep feedforward network wasn't effective (feature maps in earlier layers get ""lost""). If you use multiple optimizers for a fraction of the layers, you won't backprop through as many layers for each optimizer, which can alleviate this problem (and address vanishing gradients).",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/i96rny/d_usefuless_of_multiple_optimizers_in_practice/

63,[D] Confusion about the Inception Score for GANs,import_FixEverything,1597341672,"I'm trying to write an implementation of the Inception score in PyTorch, but I'm a bit confused about it. In the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03498.pdf) it says:

&gt; We apply the Inception model to every generated image to get the conditional label distribution p(y|x). Images that contain meaningful objects should have a conditional label distribution p(y|x) with low entropy. Moreover, we expect the model to generate varied images, so the marginal 􏰁∫p(y|x = G(z))dz should have high entropy. Combining these two requirements, the metric that we propose is: exp(E_x KL(p(y|x)||p(y))), where we exponentiate results so the values are easier to compare.

They never explicitly define x, y, and z, and (I assume) rely on the reader to be familiar with the convention of x as the data distribution, z as the latent distribution, and y as the labels for the data.

My confusion is, what is p(y) in this case? Is it the distribution of classified labels over the generated samples or over the true dataset?",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/i94ts1/d_confusion_about_the_inception_score_for_gans/

72,[R] Manifolds for Unsupervised Visual Anomaly Detection,boltzBrain,1597334411,"**Abstract:** Anomalies are by definition rare, thus labeled examples are very limited or nonexistent, and likely do not cover unforeseen scenarios. Unsupervised learning methods that don't necessarily encounter anomalies in training would be immensely useful. Generative vision models can be useful in this regard but do not sufficiently represent normal and abnormal data distributions. To this end, we propose constant curvature manifolds for embedding data distributions in unsupervised visual anomaly detection. Through theoretical and empirical explorations of manifold shapes, we develop a novel hyperspherical Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) via stereographic projections with a gyroplane layer - a complete equivalent to the Poincaré VAE. This approach with manifold projections is beneficial in terms of model generalization and can yield more interpretable representations. We present state-of-the-art results on visual anomaly benchmarks in precision manufacturing and inspection, demonstrating real-world utility in industrial AI scenarios. We further demonstrate the approach on the challenging problem of histopathology: our unsupervised approach effectively detects cancerous brain tissue from noisy whole-slide images, learning a smooth, latent organization of tissue types that provides an interpretable decisions tool for medical professionals.

90,[R] On Feature Relevance Uncertainty: A Monte Carlo Dropout Sampling Approach,neurontwister,1597322712,"**Abstract:** Understanding decisions made by neural networks is key for the deployment of intelligent systems in real world applications. However, the opaque decision making process of these systems is a disadvantage where interpretability is essential. Many feature-based explanation techniques have been introduced over the last few years in the field of machine learning to better understand decisions made by neural networks and have become an important component to verify their reasoning capabilities. However, existing methods do not allow statements to be made about the uncertainty regarding a feature's relevance for the prediction. In this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo Relevance Propagation (MCRP) for feature relevance uncertainty estimation. A simple but powerful method based on Monte Carlo estimation of the feature relevance distribution to compute feature relevance uncertainty scores that allow a deeper understanding of a neural network's perception and reasoning.

What happens when I put this model into production, and lets say I get a datapoint that is at 31 megawatts.  How does the model interpret that?  When I normalize to feed data into the production model, wouldn't the normalized value always be 1.0 if the value is greater than all of the other values?

i am currently working on a project where i decided that it might be useful to use machine learning to my advantage. I have a good understanding of pytorch and i know how to build my nn within this framework.

But currently i am struggeling to find the perfect kind of nn to solve my problem.

Let me describe the problem in an easy way:

You have a game which you have developed and you want to develop an anti cheat for all sorts of cases. Now just for an example i will choose ""fly-hacking"". What i am trying to do is record all of a players data over a period of time. Let's say within 1 second i will take n ""snapshots"" of a current players state over e.g. 5 seconds. This data includes the position vector in a 3-dimensional space (x,y,z), and some data of his surroundings which will be just split up in small areas (e.g. 3x3x3 matrix), now if i know there are solid objects in his surroundings they will be represented by 1 and if an area is empty it is 0.

Now my input data could be looking like this for a standing person: (4.2, 10.2, 3.2, 0, 0, 0, 0, \[....\], 0, 1, 1, 1) which would just be representing a player who is standing on a plane with nothing else arround him. And if i collect this data over 5 seconds with e.g. 3 snapshots per second i would end up with an array of 15 datasets.

I want to collect a hole lot of these datasets from which i already know if the player flew in this time or not. I just need a fitting neural network model which would fit my problem best.

In the end i think it is just a classification problem between ""flying"" and ""not flying"" but i am struggeling with the idea of which model would learn the fastest and easiest from this data.

Up to 64,000 IPUs per ""IPU Pod""",uneven_piles,1597290256,"The GC200 is the successor to their initial IPU chip. This new chip has 900mb of on-chip memory and 1472 cores vs 300mb and 1216 cores on the old one. The M2000 is a 1U system containing four GC200's and up to 500GB of off-chip memory. The on-chip and off-chip memory is integrated via ""exchange memory"", they say. Each M2000 unit costs $32k.

They claim to integrate with Pytorch, Tensorflow, ONNX and PaddlePaddle.

I'd really like to see them on MLPerf. They have [benchmarks](https://www.graphcore.ai/benchmarks) which look promising (I'm not sure if this is data from their old GC2 chips), but marketing can be sneaky, and I've yet to hear of any ""real world"" usage. Maybe now that their system scales to 64k machines we'll start seeing them on MLPerf in future rounds. 

Here's a comment from their GC200 / M2000 / IPU-POD64 release video:

&gt;It’s true that GPUs have improved a lot, recently. But I wanted to give a sense of how much more powerful Graphcore’s made-for-AI technology is. Our system delivers three times more arithmetic performance with much higher memory density. And you get 100 times the memory bandwidth, all for a very similar cost. Take a state of the art image classification model, EfficientNet B4, and running it on our new M2000 system, it is more than 32 times faster than an nVidia V100 GPU-based system. That means, compared to performance figures for the very latest 7nm GPU, our M2000 is still over, 16 times faster. To put that in some perspective, 16 of the new DGX A100s would cost you more than three million dollars, versus just $260 thousand for eight Graphcore M2000s delivering equivalent performance.

23,[P] Factors that exist in the testing set but not the training set,lonelyselection,1597286765,"The problem is as follows: (I did all of this in R in case it will make any differences)

I have a df with \~1000 rows and 122 columns (variables), in which the last column is my target variable. It is factored and its levels are: aa, ab, ac, ad, bb, cc ... etc. Then I split the df into 80% training and 20% testing df. Then I train 3 models (KNN, random forest, and SVM) with the training df and use each models to predict the testing df. Finally, I ensemble the models (with the voting method --&gt; for example, if 2 of those 3 models predict the target be aa, then the predicted value will be aa).

Here's the problem:

When I do confusion matrix for each model (KNN, rf, SVM), it has NO problem or warning. However, when I do a confusion Matrix on the ensemble model, I got the warnings:

        Warning messages:
        1: In levels(reference) != levels(data) :
          longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
        2: In confusionMatrix.default(as.factor(predicted.target$target), test.df[, :
          Levels are not in the same order for reference and data. Refactoring data to match.

I believe the problem is that the predicted data do not contain all the target variables as in the testing data, because when I do \`levels()\` for testing and predicted, they are different. For example (I shorten them because otherwise they will be too long):

        &gt; levels(as.factor(predicted.target$target))
        &gt; aa, ab, ad
        &gt; levels(testing_data[,122])

Hello,

I'm currently starting my second year of data science master degree.

As courses are more theoreticals than praticals, I worked a bit on kaggle competitions to train myself.

However, I saw something that bother me : I work hard on doing more or less complex models, on doing features engineering, on GridSearch to find the best superparameters ... But it's allway a simpler model that have a better score.

For example, I am currently working on [NLP with disaster tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview) : my best score (0.801) is my second model, that is just a random forest on the simplest Bag Of Words. Then, I added features, made more advanced BagOfWords, used LSTM with GloVe embedding, but never made better than that.

It's possible it's just lack of luck, (or too much luck - on the random forest), but I had the same thing while working on titanic...

Is it something you've seen ?

I just started a new job as an ML engineer and after looking at the codebase (Python) I'll be working with, I want to weep.

Let's say if we pick any one repo, then all it does is: (1) reads data, (2) transforms it, (3) trains a model and saves it. There is also another process that scores new data based on the trained model and saves the results somewhere else, so both processes are daily batch jobs scheduled with Airflow.

The trouble is that all this code is written in a procedural fashion with each step being a function of about 10,000 lines of PySpark code. Most functions simply do something like `df.groupBy(...).filter(...).agg(...).select(...)` etc. It's got to be a nightmare to test, debug and maintain.

I haven't worked with Spark in several years, so I'm a bit rusty, but I feel that the data processing functions should be moved to pure HQL and executed with a tool like [DBT](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt) which has testing and macro capabilities and it would also make the data flow more transparent.

Reinforcement Learning is a powerful tool, but it lacks biological plausibility because it learns a fixed policy network. Animals use neuroplasticity to reconfigure their policies on the fly and quickly adapt to new situations. This paper uses Hebbian Learning, a biologically inspired technique, to have agents adapt random networks to high-performing solutions as an episode is progressing, leading to agents that can reconfigure themselves in response to new observations.

Instead, I would like to learn `g(r) ≃ f(r)` and to find local minima of the learned function within some error bar `err`. I am free to generate arbitrary learning datasets as long as they are not too large. I hope that learning the function in the proximity of a few local minima will enable me to do that.

So my workflow is as follows: I learn the function `g` from the dataset of `{r_i -&gt; f(r_i)}`, I test its values `|g(r) - f(r)| &lt; err` and then I minimize the learned function `g`. This produces reasonable `r_min` (i.e. it remains close to the local minimum), however, `|g(r_min) - f(r_min)| &gt; err` is still too large. Despite my dataset containing a lot of data close to local minima and despite random checks producing reasonable error bars minimization of `g(r)` always ends up at some ""special"" values of `r_min` with a much larger error bar.

My NN is quite simple (4 layers) and the learning process just minimizes `|g(r) - f(r)|`. What can go wrong here?",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/i8a0rx/p_learning_minima_of_an_ndscalar_function/

76,[D] How to go about detecting if an image is from thispersondoesnotexist.com,regalalgorithm,1597217913,"As this is not my area of research, would like to ask you all for some info: if I were to want to implement a little app to evaluate an image of a face for whether it was generated by [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com), what would be the best way to go about it?

The most straighforward thing would be to just take the discriminator of StyleGan2 and have it provide its estimate, but how well would the work (what's the accuracy for discriminators these days, does the generator just get good at fooling it)?

I've also found [this API](https://sensity.ai/api/) that looks promising, is there anything similar you know of? Or otherwise a nice open source project that implements this image of face -&gt; GAN or not prediction, perhaps based on research in this area.

5,A Conversation with a Genuine Imitation Artificial Intelligence [D],GilSyswerda,1597182806,"The top natural language processing (NLP) system today, or at least the one getting the most press, is GPT-3 from OpenAI. GPT-3 is trained using a large quantity of human-generated text to create an enormously complicated probability distribution. This probability distribution can be used to predict what text might come next based on what text came before. The resulting system can generate unlimited examples of text that sound like intelligent humans wrote them. To use GPT-3, you give it some prior text and it then generates following text that often sounds very convincing. 

A goal of NLP is to create conversational systems. GPT-3 can simulate a conversational system by taking as input the last part of a conversation and then generating a reasonably convincing next response. 

Suppose we want to take a more straightforward approach, and replace the complicated and expensive probability distribution of a GPT-3-like conversational agent with a collection of people? This approach is not that far fetched, since it was a collection of people that created the training data for GPT-3 in the first place. The results should be similar, right?

22,[P] TransformerSum: Summarization Training and Inference Library,HHousen7,1597169941,"Hello everyone. I just recently released a library and several pre-trained models called `TransformerSum` ([GitHub](https://github.com/HHousen/TransformerSum), [Docs](https://transformersum.readthedocs.io/en/latest)). The library aims to make it easy to *train*, *evaluate*, and *use* machine learning **transformer models** that perform **automatic summarization**. It features tight integration with [huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) which enables the easy usage of a **wide variety of architectures** and **pre-trained models**. There is a heavy emphasis on code **readability** and **interpretability** so that both beginners and experts can build new components. Both the extractive and abstractive model classes are written using [pytorch\_lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning), which handles the PyTorch training loop logic, enabling **easy usage of advanced features** such as 16-bit precision, multi-GPU training, and [much more](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/). `TransformerSum` supports both the extractive and abstractive summarization of **long sequences** (4,096 to 16,000 tokens) using the [longformer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/longformer.html) (extractive) and [LongformerEncoderDecoder](https://github.com/allenai/longformer/tree/encoderdecoder) (abstractive), which is a combination of [BART](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bart.html) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461)) and the longformer. `TransformerSum` also contains models that can run on resource-limited devices while still maintaining high levels of accuracy. Models are automatically evaluated with the **ROUGE metric** but human tests can be conducted by the user.

* GitHub: [https://github.com/HHousen/TransformerSum](https://github.com/HHousen/TransformerSum)
* Documentation: [https://transformersum.readthedocs.io/en/latest](https://transformersum.readthedocs.io/en/latest)

Features:

* For extractive summarization, compatible with every [huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) transformer encoder model.
* For abstractive summarization, compatible with every [huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) EncoderDecoder model.
* Currently, 10+ pre-trained extractive models available to summarize text trained on 3 datasets (CNN-DM, WikiHow, and ArXiv-PebMed).
* Contains pre-trained models that excel at summarization on resource-limited devices: On CNN-DM, `mobilebert-uncased-ext-sum` achieves about 97% of the performance of [BertSum](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10318) while containing 4.45 times fewer parameters. It achieves about 94% of the performance of [MatchSum (Zhong et al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08795), the current extractive state-of-the-art.
* Contains code to train models that excel at summarizing long sequences: The [longformer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/longformer.html) (extractive) and [LongformerEncoderDecoder](https://github.com/allenai/longformer/tree/encoderdecoder) (abstractive) can summarize sequences of lengths up to 4,096 tokens by default, but can be trained to summarize sequences of more than 16k tokens.
* Integration with [huggingface/nlp](https://github.com/huggingface/nlp) means any summarization dataset in the `nlp` library can be used for both abstractive and extractive training.
* ""Smart batching"" support to not perform unnecessary calculations (speeds up training).
* Use of `pytorch_lightning` for code readability.
* Extensive documentation.
* Two pooling modes (convert word vectors to sentence embeddings): mean of word embeddings or use the CLS token.

Check out the [installation instructions](https://transformersum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/getting-started.html#install) and the [tutorial](https://transformersum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/getting-started.html#tutorial) to get started training models and summarizing text.

This project accomplishes a task similar to [BertSum](https://github.com/nlpyang/BertSum)/[PreSumm](https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm) (and is based on their research). However, `TransformerSum` improves various aspects and adds several features on top of `BertSum`/`PreSumm`. A full list of improvements can be found on the [differences page of the documentation](https://transformersum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/differences.html).

Unfortunately, I do not have results or pre-trained models for `LongformerEncoderDecoder` (long abstractive summarization) or the `longformer` (long extractive summarization) because I do not have the resources to train such models. However, they can easily be trained in one command ([more details on the abstractive training page](https://transformersum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abstractive/training.html#abstractive-long-summarization)) as long as you have enough computational power. I soon may have access to the GPUs required to train these models.

26,Using a dictionary to create itself [D],GilSyswerda,1597166533,"Here’s a thought experiment:

Let’s say we have an English dictionary with about 50,000 words. For this exercise, we won’t care about pronunciation or word origins. Each word has a set of definitions along with the associated usage (e.g. verb, noun), and the definitions are themselves given in English. The dictionary is self-contained in that no words are used in the definitions that aren’t themselves in the dictionary. 

As an example (using [dictionary.com](https://dictionary.com)), the definitions of \_slack\_ are given in five parts: adjective, adverb, noun, verb (used with object), and verb (used without object). There are 24 definitions in all. 

How much knowledge is there in a dictionary? All the words are there, plus definitions using those words. There must be a lot. For example, here is the first definition for the word \_emotion\_: 

\&gt; an affective state of consciousness in which joy, sorrow, fear, hate, or the like, is experienced, as distinguished from cognitive and volitional states of consciousness

That definition packs a lot in!

We now want to use the dictionary to create its own definitions. To do this, we train a system using the technology in GPT-3, where the training data is the dictionary minus a target word. Once trained, we use the resulting system to generate definition(s) for the target word. We repeat this for all 50k words. The criteria for success is that a person would find the definitions useful and meaningful. 

Some questions:

Is this even possible? A target word will likely be used in many other definitions, making the inference of the target word’s meanings and usages at least a possibility. 

If this doesn’t work, what is missing? People can create meaningful definitions of words using just words. What are they bringing to the table that is missing from the dictionary? 

Suppose we add more training data, such as the training data used to train GPT-3. Would that work? If it doesn’t, does that imply something is lacking in the technological approach?

If it does work, might it be possible to create the best dictionary in the history of dictionaries? After all, GPT-3 considers more word usages than any single person is capable of.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/i7vvx0/using_a_dictionary_to_create_itself_d/

I've looked at ARIMA, LSTM Neural Network and VAR but I'm confused over what one is best to use. Most of the tutorials I've found only use one column (e.g. an ARIMA forecast on just Close)

Abstract  
 We introduce a very deep and light-weight transformer, DeLighT, that delivers similar or better performance than transformer-based models with significantly fewer parameters. DeLighT more efficiently allocates parameters both (1) within each Transformer block using DExTra, a deep and light-weight transformation, and (2) across blocks using block-wise scaling, that allows for shallower and narrower DeLighT blocks near the input and wider and deeper DeLighT blocks near the output. Overall, DeLighT networks are 2.5 to 4 times deeper than standard transformer models and yet have fewer parameters and operations. Experiments on machine translation and language modeling tasks show that DeLighT matches the performance of baseline Transformers with significantly fewer parameters. On the WMT'14 En-Fr high resource dataset, DeLighT requires 1.8 times fewer parameters and 2 times fewer operations and achieves better performance (+0.4 BLEU score) than baseline transformers. On the WMT'16 En-Ro low resource dataset, DeLighT delivers similar performance with 2.8 times fewer parameters than baseline transformers.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/i7tb0o/d_a_brief_paper_review_delight_very_deep_and/

If the positional encodings are way bigger than the embedding vectors then the addition of them will overpower the embedding vectors. If the positional encodings are much smaller than the embedding vectors, then the positional encodings will not even be noticed. Is there a general rule here?

I wrote the first one already, it will be about PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization).

I pretty much have all the code I need for the second one: DeepNeuroEvolution from scratch (Based on Uber's paper. 

When I say from scratch, it's really low level Pytorch API, which is quite close to Numpy in term of low-levelness, so I'd believe ""from scratch"" is appropriate. But I'm still struggling to find a toy problem to work with, but not too toyish either.

If you don't know about DeepNeuroEvolution, it allows to train ANN without gradient descent, so no derivative involved. It's an alternative to RL but there is no reason it should be limited to it. 

  
I'm interested if you had any inputs, on two axis:

* Cool toy problems
* Underground/outdated/unknown genetic algos

  
If it can give you ideas, I'm working on evolving ANN structurally (with algos of the  NEAT familly) then training them with DNE.

GPT-3 can generate code. Could it (and next iterations) be in some ways creative at writing code that would improve itself ?

Today are releasing a new version for [Kornia](https://www.kornia.org) that includes different functionalities to work with **3D augmentations** and **volumetric data**, **local features matching**, **homographies** and **epipolar geometry**.

In short, we list the following new features:

* Support to PyTorch v1.6.0.
* Local descriptors matching, homography and epipolar geometry API.
* 3D augmentations and low level API to work with volumetric data.

## Local features matching

We include an [kornia.feature.matching](https://kornia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/feature.html#matching) API to perform local descriptors matching such classical and derived version of the nearest neighbor (NN).

In addition, we have ported some of the existing algorithms from [opencv.sfm](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d8/d8c/group__sfm.html) to PyTorch under [kornia.geometry.epipolar](https://kornia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/geometry.epipolar.html) that includes different functionalities to work with **Fundamental**, **Essential** or **Projection** matrices, and **Triangulation** methods useful for Structure from Motion problems.

## 3D augmentations and volumetric

We expand the [kornia.augmentaion](https://kornia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/augmentation.html) with a series of operators to perform 3D augmentations for volumetric data.

https://i.redd.it/sy3lviwl3cg51.gif

In this release, we include the following first set of geometric 3D augmentations methods:

* RandomDepthicalFlip3D (along depth axis)
* RandomVerticalFlip3D (along height axis)
* RandomHorizontalFlip3D (along width axis)
* RandomRotation3D
* RandomAffine3D

Finally, we introduce also a low level API to perform 4D features transformations [kornia.warp\_projective](https://kornia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/geometry.transform.html#kornia.geometry.transform.warp_projective) and extending the filtering operators to support 3D kernels [kornia.filter3D](https://kornia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/filters.html#kornia.filters.filter3D).

I'm working on a project were we are trying to optimize which marketing to show, and where, to maximise sales (it's not online and all customers will see the marketing before buying). We have a set of ads and at any given time a subset of them are shown in some positions.

So far so good. We can use this to (together with time of day etc) predict the sales with a fairly simple NN. But now we need to be able to change some of the ads to new ones. And I'm trying to figure out how to handle this without wasting data. Some options:

1. Just add more inputs for the new data. Positions x has 5 possible ads which gives 5 columns if using a binary encoding. If adding one ad it would have six. This is clearly not sustainable in the long run.
2. Throw out all samples that contain the old ads. This wastes a lot of data.

Do you have any other suggestions? You could have a model per ad by then you loss the model can't learn the interaction between ads since they are shown together?",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/i7nxlw/p_changing_input_features_without_loss_all_data/

We present extensive discussions on challenges, research trends, and directions related to deepfake technologies. 

By reviewing the background of deepfakes and state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods, this study provides a comprehensive overview of deepfake techniques and facilitates the development of new and more robust methods to deal with the increasingly challenging deepfakes.

65,[Research] SurVAE Flows: Surjections to Bridge the Gap between VAEs and Flows,_djab_,1597127697,"Normalizing flows and variational autoencoders are powerful generative models that can represent complicated density functions. However, they both impose constraints on the models: Normalizing flows use bijective transformations to model densities whereas VAEs learn stochastic transformations that are non-invertible and thus typically do not provide tractable estimates of the marginal likelihood. In this paper, we introduce SurVAE Flows: A modular framework of composable transformations that encompasses VAEs and normalizing flows. SurVAE Flows bridge the gap between normalizing flows and VAEs with surjective transformations, wherein the transformations are deterministic in one direction -- thereby allowing exact likelihood computation, and stochastic in the reverse direction -- hence providing a lower bound on the corresponding likelihood. We show that several recently proposed methods, including dequantization and augmented normalizing flows, can be expressed as SurVAE Flows. Finally, we introduce common operations such as the max value, the absolute value, sorting, and stochastic permutation as composable layers in SurVAE Flows.

The topology of graph is not constant and changes. The output is a vector of binary numbers each for a node. Since there is a clear definition for reward and state and also I, as a human, can make mostly good decision using intuition, RL seems to be a good approach to use as a heuristic.

One approach is to use adjacency matrix as input which I don't think is a good solution.",MachineLearning,False,/r/MachineLearning/comments/i7d96d/r_how_to_use_rl_for_a_problem_with_varying_input/

87,"[D] If you check hold-out performance, make some changes, then check new hold-out performance...",FourierSSB,1597087432,"Aren’t you simply fitting your hold-out data? This point confuses me. There are so many tutorials that are like “hmm accuracy low. Let’s add in some [insert algorithm tweaking] and... performance improved!” 

Shouldn’t you only test hold-out accuracy one single time and accept it is what it is? Wouldn’t you need a new hold-out set to test on if you do anything differently?

I have a meeting with my boss in two days and my results are poor and he has been used to employees showing him good results (which I think are mostly just based on dishonest practices / unintentional overfitting / arbitrary “outlier” removal). I’m guessing he’s going to ask me to try basically anything to get it to work, even though I feel like I did the right things.

For example, feature extraction in my case is a pipeline with many of its own parameters. If I just try tweaking those parameters until my test accuracy is up to his expected standard, have I not simply overfit to my hold-out data?

88,[D] How you know that something will just never work and should be abandoned,FourierSSB,1597086070,"My coworker is working on a project that performs classification based on features extracted from medical images. Long story short, his results aren’t great and so I asked him to send me his data and the results I got were even worse. I’d conclude that the features are non-informative and move on; however, this is the culmination of nearly 20 years of research and development. I think the big issue is that over the years, vulnerable employees have fudged things on top of fudging things and the truth is that it never really worked and any published results were a product of A) massive over fitting and B) publishing in journals that are clinically focused rather than computer science.

What do you do when you have a classification task that just won’t work? 211 samples, 201 features, feature selection + hyper-parameter tuning, minority class over sampling (4:1 class imbalance), a few different models... best classifier is just choose majority class and if not, the accuracy is basically a coin toss.

I am pretty proficient with SQL and I feel like in a lot of cases I can compute most basic features for ML models directly within SQL queries. I feel like these platforms are probably more efficient at aggregating/joining relational data since they are optimized for that purpose, but I wonder if there are additional benefits to leveraging spark for feature engineering.

94,"[D] Synthetic data generation, closing the reality gap?",good_rice,1597082730,"I've done a preliminary dive on data generation for creating perfectly accurate 6-DOF or depth data, and I've found three approaches.

\- Style-transfer on synthetic images to create realistic images for training \[[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04280)\]

\- Style-transfer on realistic images to change them to synthetic looking images during inference \[[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07252)\]

\- Photorealistic synthetic images for training [\[3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10790.pdf)\] 

For my problem, all images are within a narrow visual appearance, but this appearance is difficult to model photorealistically (dust + many random surface imperfections on each object instance). This first approach seems the most promising for my problem, as I also have a large dataset of real life images + a non-realistic simulator. 

I was wondering if anyone has more background or papers they remember regarding the first approach. The paper linked is not highly cited, and I haven't been able to find more research in this direction. I imagine for most big labs, creating a photorealistic simulator is feasible and more concrete than using another network for style-transfer.

98,[D] Approaching document classification: highly imbalanced dataset,dondraper36,1597080793,"Hi, 

I am working on quite a challenging project that involves document classification. There are actually more than 15 classes, but for now, I am just working with the top 5 of them. The dataset is anyway severely imbalanced in that the top 2 classes constitute over 80% of the data.   
Another source of complexity is that, as you understand, the same document type can have various types of layouts depending on the company, and even within one company it might be different. 

My initial attempt was based on treating documents as images, but this one didn't succeed since some documents are very similar visually so the visual-based classifier fails badly trying to tell the difference between such document types. 

What approaches would you recommend with regard to NLP?   
I have tried tf-idf vectorizer + naive Bayes/linear SVM, but the results are not that great, and I believe such methods are far from being state-of-the-art as of today. 

I know that a lot of projects use BERT transformers from hugging face for anything text-related and there are libraries like FastText that can handle classification pretty well. 

Nevertheless, I would highly appreciate some guidance with regard to what approach could work well for imbalanced data and document classification in general.
